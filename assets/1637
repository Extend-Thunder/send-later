The easiest way to install it is to open the add-ons page in Thunderbird, search for Send Later, and install it (&#8220;Send Later,&#8221; <em>not<\/em> &#8220;Send Later Button&#8221;!) from the search results.<\/p>\n<p>Send Later has been almost completely rewritten for Thunderbird 78, thanks to the yeoman efforts of Jonathan Perry-Houts. Because of this, a new user guide will need to be written for the new version of the add-on. Because the new version has a lot of functionality in common with the old one, much of the information below regarding the Thunderbird 68 version is still accurate for Thunderbird 78, but not all of it is. This user guide will remain targeted for Thunderbird 68; when there is a new user guide available for Thunderbird 78, we will link to it here.<\/p>\n<p>Here is some additional information about my other add-ons and Thunderbird 78:<\/p>\n<div class=\"moz-text-html\" lang=\"x-unicode\">\n<p>Efforts are underway to port most of my add-ons to Thunderbird 78. My original plan was to fund this work with a Kickstarter campaign, after which the add-ons were going to be switching from a free model to a paid license model. However, even during the campaign my hope was that I would be able to find a way to use the proceeds of the campaign to allow the add-ons to continue to be available for free. At this point that does appear to be what has happened. In short: <i>my current plan is that once the add-ons are ported to Thunderbird 78, they will remain free for all to use.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>The current status of my other add-ons is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Folder Pane View Switcher is now available for Thunderbird 78 <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/folder-pane-view-switcher\/\">on addons.thunderbird.net<\/a>. There are some outstanding issues, which are documented (with workarounds) <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Extended-Thunder\/folder-pane-view-switcher\/issues\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Remove Content By Folder is now available for Thunderbird 78 <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/remote-content-by-folder\/\">on addons.thunderbird.net<\/a>. There are some outstanding issues, which are documented <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Extended-Thunder\/remote-content-by-folder\/issues\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>userChromeJS: The current version of userChromeJS <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/userchromejs-2\/\">available on addons.thunderbird.net<\/a> is compatible with Thunderbird 78.<\/li>\n<li>Show All Body Parts: Although this add-on is not yet available for Thunderbird 78, there is a workaround:\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Thunderbird Preferences.<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Config Editor&#8230;&#8221; in the Advanced section of the General preferences.<\/li>\n<li>In the search box, enter &#8220;mailnews.display.show_all_body_parts_menu&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>If the status of the &#8220;mailnews.display.show_all_body_parts_menu&#8221; doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;modified&#8221; there, then double-click on it to change the status to &#8220;modified&#8221;, which will set its value to True.<\/li>\n<li>You should now see the &#8220;All Body Parts&#8221; View mode in the Thunderbird menus. Changing this hidden preference is literally all the add-on does, so if you set the preference this way, then you don&#8217;t need the add-on at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>IMAP Received Date: Although this add-on is not yet available for Thunderbird 78, there is a workaround:\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Thunderbird Preferences.<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Config Editor&#8230;&#8221; in the Advanced section of the General preferences.<\/li>\n<li>Enter &#8220;mailnews.customDBHeaders&#8221; (without the quotes) into the search box.<\/li>\n<li>If it&#8217;s not there, right-click in the search results area, select New &gt; String, enter &#8220;mailnews.customDBHeaders&#8221; (without the quotes) as the preference name to create and click OK, and enter &#8220;Received&#8221; (without the quotes) as the value and click OK again.<\/li>\n<li>If, on the other hand, &#8220;mailnews.customDBHeaders&#8221; shows up in the search results, then double-click on it to edit the value, enter a space and then &#8220;Received&#8221; (without the quotes) at the end of the value, and click OK.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>My other add-ons, Enhanced Priority Display, Reply to Multiple Messages, Toggle Replied, and Undigestify, are not yet available for Thunderbird 78, but we&#8217;re working on them. We&#8217;re hoping to have more progress to report some time in October, though that date may slip.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>People have asked if they can contribute to the Kickstarter campaign or contribute to these add-ons in general. The Kickstarter campaign has closed and can no longer accept contributions, and in any case there is no need to contribute to it since as noted above our current plan is for all of the add-ons to continue to be free. As for contributing to me personally to acknowledge my work on these add-ons, there are unfortunately a lot of people nowadays who need financial help more than I do, so I am asking people who are inspired to contribute to these add-ons to instead pick a worthy charity and donate there instead.<\/p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"mailto:send-later-support@extended-thunder.org\">email the maintainers<\/a> (<strong>don&#8217;t<\/strong> post comments below)&nbsp;if you have any further questions.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2><a id=\"toc\" href=\"#toc\">Table of contents<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>(Clicking on section headers in the text will return you to the table of contents.)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#intro\">Introduction<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#install\">Installation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#usage\">Basic usage<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#date-formats\">Date formats<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#prefs\">Preferences<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#presets\">Preset buttons<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#toolbar\">Toolbar<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#send-later-button\">&#8220;I want a &#8216;Send Later&#8217; button!&#8221;<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#caveats\">Caveats and known issues<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#bad-mail-servers\">Send Later doesn&#8217;t work with mail servers that discard its &#8220;X-Send-Later&#8221; headers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#running\">Thunderbird must be running for scheduled messages to be sent<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#receipt\">Return receipts don&#8217;t work<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#windows-hangs\">Thunderbird hangs frequently on Windows<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#errors\">Errors you might encounter<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#missing-drafts-folder\">Missing drafts folder<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#advanced\">Advanced usage<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#hotkeys\">Hot keys<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#recurring\">Recurring messages<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#mailmerge\">Mail Merge add-on<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#owl\">Owl for Exchange add-on<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dynamic\">Dynamic functions for complex scheduling rules<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#dynamic-recurrence\">Dynamic recurrence<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#senddrafts\">Suppressing scheduled message delivery<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#server-side\">Server-side Send Later<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dynamic_sendbutton\">Making &#8220;Send&#8221; do &#8220;Send Later&#8221; only some of the time<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#milliseconds\">Checking for scheduled messages more than once per minute<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#outbox\">Messages don&#8217;t send or send multiple times<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#gmail\">Send errors with Gmail when Thunderbird is configured to save copies<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#debug\">Debug logging<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improve\">Helping to improve the add-on<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#translate\">Translations<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#hacking\">Hacking<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#help\">Getting help<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mailing-list\">The &#8220;Send Later users&#8221; mailing list<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#contact-me\">Contacting the developer<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#remote-support\">Remote support<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#resources\">Other resources<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#donate\">Support Send Later!<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-addons\">Check out my other add-ons<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#credits\">Credits<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#supporters\">Supporters<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#notes\">Release Notes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#comments\">Comments on this page<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"intro\" href=\"#toc\">Introduction<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The Send Later Thunderbird add-on&nbsp;allows you you to write an email message and then tell Thunderbird when you want it to be sent. The message is then saved back into your Drafts folder, and delivered at approximately the specified time. The add-on is available for download from <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/send-later-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">addons.thunderbird.net<\/a>. Release notes for each new release of Send Later are published there and <a href=\"#notes\">below<\/a>. What follows is a user manual for the add-on. Everything below (except for the installation section) assumes that you&#8217;ve already installed the add-on from <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/send-later-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">addons.thunderbird.net<\/a> and restarted your mail app. If you have any comments, questions or feedback about the add-on, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:send-later-support@extended-thunder.org\">email the maintainers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This user manual is written for Thunderbird 68 or newer. Things might be slightly different for older versions.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"install\" href=\"#toc\">Installation<\/a><\/h2>\n<h3>Method 1<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In Thunderbird, open the add-ons dialog with the &#8220;Tools &gt; Add-ons&#8221; menu-bar command or &#8220;Add-ons&#8221; from the three-lines menu in the upper right corner of the main Thunderbird window.<\/li>\n<li>Enter &#8220;Send Later&#8221; in the search box and hit Enter.<\/li>\n<li>Find the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; add-on (<strong><em>not<\/em><\/strong> &#8220;Send Later Button&#8221;) in the search results and click the &#8220;Add to Thunderbird&#8221; button.<\/li>\n<li>When it&#8217;s done installing, restart Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Method 2 (use only if Method 1 doesn&#8217;t work)<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the add-on as an &#8220;.xpi&#8221; file from <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/send-later-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">addons.thunderbird.net<\/a>, saving it to your Desktop or another obvious location.<\/li>\n<li>In Thunderbird, select the &#8220;Tools &gt; Add-ons&#8221; menu-bar command or &#8220;Add-ons&#8221; from the three-lines menu.<\/li>\n<li>Click the gear icon to the left of the search box and select &#8220;Install Add-on From File&#8230;&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Browse to the downloaded Send Later &#8220;.xpi&#8221; file and open it.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure your mouse is over the install dialog and it has focus. When the &#8220;Install&#8221; button becomes active, click on it.<\/li>\n<li>Restart Thunderbird when it tells you to after the add-on is installed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><a id=\"usage\" href=\"#toc\">Basic usage<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>When you want to schedule a message for later delivery, either select the File &gt; Send Later menu command in the message composition window, or hit Ctrl-Shift-Enter. This will pop up the following dialog:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/dialog.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5671 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/dialog.png?resize=300%2C239&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Send Later prompt window\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/dialog.png?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/dialog.png?w=606&amp;ssl=1 606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is what you can do from this dialog:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specify a specific time at which to send the message.<\/strong> Tell Send Later in the text box when you would like the message to be sent, or use the date and time pickers below the text box if you prefer. The text box understands <a href=\"#date-formats\">lots of different formats<\/a>, so give it a try! When you&#8217;ve entered a date\/time that the add-on understands, the button below it will become active and &#8220;Enter a valid date above&#8221; will be replaced with what you entered. Click the button or type Ctrl-Enter, or just Enter if your cursor is in the text box, to schedule the message.<br \/>\n<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:<\/strong> You will only see the date and time pickers if you have the Lightning add-on installed and enabled. Otherwise, you need to use the text box.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Schedule a recurring message on a fixed schedule.<\/strong> See <a href=\"#recurring\">below<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Schedule a one-shot or recurring message using one of the built-in scheduling functions or a function you&#8217;ve written or imported yourself.<\/strong> See <a href=\"#dynamic\">below<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Send the message using one of the preset buttons.<\/strong> Click &#8220;15 mins later&#8221;, &#8220;30 mins later&#8221;, or &#8220;2 hours later&#8221; to send the message the indicated amount of time into the future.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deposit the message into your Outbox for later delivery by Thunderbird.<\/strong> If you click &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; (see <a href=\"#buttons\">below<\/a> for why you won&#8217;t always see this button), the message will be copied immediately into your Outbox. This is the behavior of the standard Thunderbird &#8220;Send Later&#8221; command before you installed the add-on. The message will then be sent if you execute File &gt; Send Unsent Messages, or if you go into and out of offline mode, or if you exit and restart Thunderbird. In the latter two cases, Thunderbird may or may not prompt for confirmation before sending unsent messages, depending on how you have configured it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Send the message immediately.<\/strong> If you click &#8220;Send Now&#8221; (see <a href=\"#buttons\">below<\/a> for why you won&#8217;t always see this button), the message will be delivered immediately, as if you had executed the &#8220;Send&#8221; command instead of &#8220;Send Later&#8221;. Note that you can activate this button by hitting Alt-N or the equivalent on your platform or in your language.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Go back to editing the message.<\/strong> Click the &#8220;Cancel&#8221; button to go back to editing the message.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Time-of-day and day-of-week restrictions<\/h3>\n<p>You can also specify time-of-day and day-of-week restrictions for when your message will be delivered.&nbsp;<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:<\/strong> You will only see the option to set a time-of-day restriction if you have the Lightning add-on installed and enabled.<\/p>\n<p>These restrictions have different (but, I hope, somewhat intuitive) effects based on what kind of scheduling you are doing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you enter restrictions with an explicit, one-shot (i.e., not recurring) send time, then Send Later will adjust the send time you specify to fall within those restrictions. Furthermore, if Thunderbird can&#8217;t send the message at the scheduled time, the restrictions you specify will be enforced when it&nbsp;<em>can<\/em> send the message, if the &#8220;Enforce time and day restrictions at delivery time&#8221; preference (see <a href=\"#prefs\">below<\/a>) is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter restrictions with a <a href=\"#recurring\">recurring send time<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"#dynamic\">dynamic scheduling function<\/a>, then they will be applied as above&nbsp;and&nbsp;also each time the message&nbsp;is rescheduled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Saving defaults<\/h3>\n<p>You can save whatever settings you enter here as the default settings for when you bring up this dialog in the future, or clear previously saved defaults, by making the appropriate selection above the big scheduled send button, before you click it. You can do some pretty fancy things with this. For example, if you enter &#8220;now&#8221; in the text box and check that you only want the message to be delivered between 9:00am and 5:00pm Monday through Friday, and then save those as your defaults, then whenever you pop up the dialog, the default behavior will be to send the message now or reschedule it for when it is during business hours. Nifty, eh?<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"buttons\"><\/a>The &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; and &#8220;Send Now&#8221; buttons<\/h3>\n<p>As noted above, the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button in the Send Later dialog causes the message to be sent immediately, i.e., it bypasses the scheduled send process, and the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button causes the message to be put directly into the Thunderbird Outbox, also bypassing the scheduled send process, but in a different way.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, both of these buttons can&#8217;t be displayed at the same time without &#8220;cheating&#8221; and integrating Send Later into Thunderbird in a way that isn&#8217;t really supposed to be done and isn&#8217;t maintainable or sustainable. Therefore, when the Send Later dialog pops up, you will only see one of these buttons or the other, as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the Send Later dialog is&nbsp;opened by typing&nbsp;Ctrl-Shift-Enter, or the &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221; menu command, or the button provided by the <a href=\"#magicslr\">&#8220;Send Later Button&#8221; add-on<\/a>, then the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button is displayed but the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button is not.<\/li>\n<li>Conversely, if the Send Later dialog is opened by typing Ctrl-Enter or &#8220;File | Send Now&#8221; or the &#8220;Send&#8221; button&nbsp;when the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference described <a href=\"#prefs\">below<\/a> is enabled, then the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button is displayed but the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button is not.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you <em>don&#8217;t<\/em> have the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference enabled, and you open the dialog with Ctrl-Shift-Enter etc. and then realize that you actually want to send the message right away, you can simply close the dialog or click the Cancel button and then send the message normally.<\/p>\n<h3>What happens when you schedule a message?<\/h3>\n<p>When you schedule a message for delivery, it is saved in your Drafts folder with the necessary scheduling information embedded in it. If you wish to reschedule a message later, just edit the saved draft and do &#8220;Send Later&#8221; again and specify the new send time. If you wish to cancel a scheduled message delivery, edit the draft and save it normally without &#8220;Send Later&#8221; (or just send it immediately, if that&#8217;s what you want to do), and the scheduling information will be removed.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"date-formats\" href=\"#toc\">Date formats<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The part of Send Later that interprets the send times you type into the text box is pretty smart. You&#8217;re welcome to type a full date and time, e.g., &#8220;10\/4\/2012 3:00pm&#8221;, if you <em>want<\/em> to, but it isn&#8217;t actually necessary. In addition to making intelligent guesses about the parts you leave out, the interpreter also understands quite a few neat shortcuts. Here are some examples, but they don&#8217;t include everything, so when in doubt, try it out, and see if it works!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t type the year if the date you&#8217;re entering is in the coming year. It&#8217;ll default to that automatically!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t type the date at all if you&#8217;re just entering a time in the next 24 hours.<\/li>\n<li>You can type a day of the week for the next instance of that day, or &#8220;next <em>day-of-week<\/em>&#8221; for the one after.<\/li>\n<li>You can type &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; or &#8220;the day after tomorrow&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>You can type &#8220;in 3 minutes&#8221; or &#8220;3 minutes from now&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/sugarjs.com\/dates\/#\/Parsing\">this page<\/a> for more examples. These apply in all of the languages that Send Later supports, not just in English. If you encounter something you think the add-on should understand but doesn&#8217;t, <a href=\"mailto:send-later-support@extended-thunder.org\">let us know<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"prefs\" href=\"#toc\">Preferences<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>You can get to the add-on&#8217;s Preferences window in three ways:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Send Later&#8221; in the status bar at the bottom of your main window and select &#8220;Send Later preferences&#8221; from the pop-up menu (there are also several other useful things in this menu). The preferences will open in a new window.<\/li>\n<li>Select the Tools &gt; Add-on Preferences &gt; Send Later menu command. The preferences will open in a new tab.<\/li>\n<li>Select Add-ons &gt; Send Later from the three-lines menu. The preferences will open in a new tab.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here is the main preferences screen, followed by explanations of the various settings:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-23_11-43.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5684\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-23_11-43.png?resize=300%2C258&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-23_11-43.png?resize=300%2C258&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-23_11-43.png?resize=660%2C568&amp;ssl=1 660w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-23_11-43.png?w=710&amp;ssl=1 710w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Check every # minutes<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls how often the add-on checks for messages whose delivery time has arrived. The default, once per minute, is adequate for most people. In rare cases, you may need to use a higher value (lower frequency) if you have a very large number of messages in your Drafts folder and the Send Later progress bar at the bottom of your Thunderbird window never goes away.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;Send&#8221; does &#8220;Send Later&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>If it is enabled, this preference causes the scheduling dialog to pop up not only when you run the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; command, but also, when you run &#8220;Send&#8221;, whether it&#8217;s by clicking the &#8220;Send&#8221; button, selecting File | Send Now, or typing Ctrl-Enter. It&#8217;ll therefore prevent you from accidentally sending a message now that you meant to schedule for later. This feature is <em>not<\/em> enabled by default.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this preference and the following one are mutually exclusive.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"send-delay\"><\/a>&#8220;Send&#8221; delays messages by: # minutes<\/h3>\n<p>If enabled, this preference causes all messages you send by clicking Send or typing Ctrl-Enter to be automatically scheduled to be sent by Send Later the specified number of minutes into the future.<\/p>\n<p>This essentially replicates the functionality provided by some email providers to allow you to cancel sending a message for a short period of time after it is sent. If you sent a message and then change your mind before the delay time has elapsed, you can simply find the message in your Drafts folder and either delete it (if you don&#8217;t want it to be sent at all) or open it for editing, which automatically cancels the scheduled send.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this preference and the previous one are mutually exclusive.<\/p>\n<h3>Mark scheduled drafts as read<\/h3>\n<p>By default when Send Later saves a scheduled messages into your Drafts folder, it marks the message as &#8220;read&#8221; so that your Drafts folder doesn&#8217;t show up in the folder list as having unread messages in it. If you prefer for scheduled Drafts to show up as &#8220;unread&#8221; to remind you that they&#8217;re there, uncheck this preference.<\/p>\n<h3>Bind Alt-Shift-Enter instead of Ctrl-Shift-Enter<\/h3>\n<p>This preference causes the pop-up Send Later dialog to be bound to the key sequence Alt-Shift-Enter instead of Ctrl-Shift-Enter. When this feature is activated, Ctrl-Shift-Enter remains the original Thunderbird functionality, i.e., depositing the message into the Outbox for sending later.<\/p>\n<h3>Enable compose window key bindings for presets<\/h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re composing a message, you can type Ctrl-Alt-1, Ctrl-Alt-2, or Ctrl-Alt-3 to activate the corresponding preset button without popping up the Send Later prompt window. If you don&#8217;t want these key bindings to be active, uncheck this preference to disable them.<\/p>\n<h3>Show Send Later Column<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls whether a column showing the scheduled delivery times of messages that have them is&nbsp;displayed when viewing a Drafts folder.<\/p>\n<h3>Show Send Later Header<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls whether the &#8220;x-send-later-at&#8221; message header, which is where the add-on stores information about when a draft should be delivered, is&nbsp;displayed when viewing drafts that have them.&nbsp;<em>(Note that this setting does not work when the Mnenhy add-on is installed.)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Show Send Later In Status Bar<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls whether the add-on shows its current status in the Status Bar at the bottom of the Thunderbird window. The number of pending scheduled messages, or &#8220;IDLE&#8221; if there are none, is displayed. If this preference is unset, then the next one is ignored.<\/p>\n<h3>Show Background Progress In Status Bar<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls whether an animated progress bar is&nbsp;shown in your Thunderbird status bar when the add-on is working, i.e., when it wakes up periodically to check for messages whose delivery time has arrived. If the previous preference is unset, then this preference is ignored.<\/p>\n<h3>Trigger unsent message delivery from Outbox<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls whether the add-on actually sends messages when their delivery time arrives, or rather should just deposit them into your Outbox and leave them there until the next time you send unsent messages as described above. You might want to disable this setting if you use some other add-on, e.g., BlunderDelay, to manage your message delivery. See the <a href=\"#caveats\">Caveats section below<\/a> for more information about this.<\/p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t deliver messages more than # minutes late<\/h3>\n<p>This preference controls what happens when Send Later that&#8217;s late because Thunderbird wasn&#8217;t running or your computer was asleep at the time it was supposed to be sent. By default, Send Later will deliver such a message at the earliest opportunity to do so after its scheduled send time. If you would rather not have messages delivered late, you can enable this preference, and then instead of delivering a late message, Send Later will pop up a warning about it and leave it for you to edit to either reschedule its send time or send it immediately by hand.<\/p>\n<h3>Enforce time and day restrictions at delivery time<\/h3>\n<p>As described <a href=\"#recurring\">below<\/a>, Send Later supports restrictions on the time of day and day of the week when recurring scheduled messages are delivered. These restrictions are enforced when a message is scheduled, i.e., the scheduled send time of a message will never violate the time and weekday restrictions specified for that message.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, this preference controls what happens when a message isn&#8217;t delivered at its scheduled time because Thunderbird isn&#8217;t running or your computer is asleep, and then when Thunderbird wakes up, the current time violates the time and\/or weekday restrictions on the message. By default, when this preference is disabled, Send Later&nbsp;delivers&nbsp;late&nbsp;messages immediately even in violation of their time\/weekday restrictions. In contrast, when the&nbsp;preference is enabled, the add-on waits until the time\/weekday restrictions are satisfied before delivery.<\/p>\n<h3>Links<\/h3>\n<p>Following these settings are links you can click on to send me email, view the user guide (i.e., this page), or make a donation to support continued development of the add-on.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"presets\" href=\"#toc\">Preset buttons<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>In addition to these main settings, you can change the behavior of the preset buttons by editing the settings of the &#8220;Shortcut&#8221; tabs of the preferences dialog:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/prefs3.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5675 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/prefs3.png?resize=300%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Send Later shortcut preferences\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/prefs3.png?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/prefs3.png?resize=660%2C534&amp;ssl=1 660w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/prefs3.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Button label<\/strong> specifies the string that is displayed in the button.

Just to be clear: the purpose of the send later button in the toolbar is to finish scheduling a message after you&#8217;ve already entered a send time in the text box.

Note that the toolbar Send Later button provided by the Send Later add-on, i.e., the one shown in the &#8220;Customize Toolbar&#8221; palette above, doesn&#8217;t pop up the Send Later prompt window. Rather, it is used to finish scheduling a message after you have entered the send time for it in the text box you&#8217;ve added to the toolbar along with the button. If you don&#8217;t add the text box to the toolbar, then that button isn&#8217;t useful.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"caveats\" href=\"#toc\">Caveats and known issues<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Some things to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whenever Send Later delivers a scheduled message, any other messages pending delivery in your Outbox will also be delivered.<\/li>\n<li>Scheduled drafts are locked to a particular Thunderbird profile and will only be delivered by a Thunderbird running against the same profile that originally scheduled them. This means that if you use Thunderbird on multiple computers to schedule messages, you need to keep it running on all of those computers for the messages to be delivered. You can &#8220;transfer&#8221; a draft from one profile to another if need be by editing and rescheduling it.<\/li>\n<li>Send Later is not yet compatible with <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/en-US\/thunderbird\/addon\/use-bcc-instead\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UseBccInstead<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>If you use distribution lists within Thunderbird and you add a distribution list to a message and then Send Later, the list will be expanded when you schedule it, <em>not<\/em> when it is sent. Any changes you make to the list between when you schedule the message and when it is sent will not be reflected in the sent message.<\/li>\n<li>Send Later is partially incompatible with the <a href=\"http:\/\/mailtweak.mozdev.org\/tweaks.html#defer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Defer&#8221; feature<\/a> of the <a href=\"http:\/\/mailtweak.mozdev.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mail Tweak<\/a> thunderbird add-on. In particular, if you have &#8220;Defer&#8221; enabled with Mail Tweak, then the Send Later dialog will pop up every time you click the &#8220;Send&#8221; button in a compose window or type Ctrl-Enter. You can click &#8220;Send Now&#8221; at that point to send the message immediately, but the extra click is annoying. Note that Mail Tweak is not compatible with recent versions of Thunderbird, so there are no plans to fix this issue.<\/li>\n<li>Attachments are frozen when messages are scheduled to be sent. In other words, if you attach a file to a message, then schedule the message with Send Later, then modify the file on disk before the scheduled message is sent, <em>your modifications will not be included in the sent message.<\/em> This is also true with recurring messages &#8212; when a recurring message is sent and automatically rescheduled, Send Later does <em>not<\/em> capture a new version of the attached files.<\/li>\n<li>Outgoing message format preferences (Preferences | Composition | General | Send Options&#8230;) do not work with Send Later.<\/li>\n<li><a id=\"icloud\"><\/a>I have been told by multiple people that messages sent from or to iCloud or me.com accounts never appear in the recipient&#8217;s inbox even though Thunderbird says they were sent successfully. Please note that this is&nbsp;<em>not<\/em> a bug in Send Later or Thunderbird, it&#8217;s a problem with iCloud. Apparently, Apple thinks it&#8217;s OK to run a mail server which arbitrarily and completely silently discards valid email messages with no notification to either the sender or recipient that this has occurred (this is discussed by others on the internet, e.g., <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/2029570\/silent-email-filtering-makes-icloud-an-unreliable-option.html\">here<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/3153039\">here<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/103703\/apple-may-be-invisibly-filtering-your-outgoing-mobileme-email-exclusive\/103703\/\">here<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/apple-slipping-lately#comment-610145\">here<\/a>). I have tried, unfortunately without success, to find a fix or workaround for this problem. The only possible fix I&#8217;ve been able to find &#8212; and I&#8217;m not actually sure it works &#8212; is to check your account settings and confirm that the outbound SMTP configuration in Thunderbird for your iCloud account matches the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT202304\">settings&nbsp;Apple says you should be using<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a id=\"exquilla\"><\/a>Send Later does not work with ExQuilla, because Send Later depends on being able to put messages into your local Outbox and then send them with the &#8220;Send Unsent Messages&#8221; command, but <a href=\"https:\/\/exquilla.zendesk.com\/entries\/25723967-Messages-stuck-in-Outbox\">&#8220;Send Unsent Messages&#8221; is not implemented in ExQuilla<\/a>. If you would like to see Send Later work with ExQuilla, I suggest you contact the maintainers of ExQuilla and ask them to make sending messages to ExQuilla from the local Outbox work properly; the more people ask, the more likely it is that they will fix this problem. Send Later <em>does<\/em> work with <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/owl-for-exchange\/\">Owl for Exchange<\/a>, the add-on which is intended to replace ExQuilla, when configured as described <a href=\"#owl\">below<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><a id=\"bad-mail-servers\" href=\"#toc\">Send Later doesn&#8217;t work with mail servers that discard its &#8220;X-Send-Later&#8221; headers<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Some mail servers (most notably, but not exclusively, Microsoft Exchange used through its IMAP gateway) prevent Send Later from working by discarding the &#8220;X-Send-Later&#8221; headers that it uses to keep track of message scheduled delivery times. You can tell that this is happening if you schedule a message for delivery, but then when you look at the message header of the scheduled draft with View &gt; Message Source, there are no &#8220;X-Send-Later&#8221; headers.<\/p>\n<p>To work around this problem, you need to store your drafts for the affected account in some other Drafts folder, e.g., the one underneath Local Folders. You can set this preference by going to Tools &gt; Account Settings&#8230; or Edit &gt; Account Settings&#8230; and viewing the &#8220;Copies &amp; Folders&#8221; page for the affected account.<\/p>\n<p>Please note: for Microsoft Exchange in particular, this workaround is only valid when you are accessing Exchange as a generic IMAP server, <em>not<\/em> when you are using ExQuilla, which as noted <a href=\"#exquilla\">just above<\/a> is incompatible with Send Later.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"running\" href=\"#toc\">Thunderbird must be running for scheduled messages to be sent<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>You need to keep Thunderbird running (and your computer turned on!) for Send Later to be able to send scheduled messages (note that on Mac OS, &#8220;running&#8221; means&nbsp;there must be at least one main Thunderbird window open; Send Later will not work if the Thunderbird app is running but doesn&#8217;t have any open windows).&nbsp;It runs within Thunderbird, which means that when you exit from Thunderbird, it&#8217;s not around to check for messages to be sent. If you fail to leave Thunderbird running over the delivery time of one or more messages, then those messages will be delivered shortly after the next time you start Thunderbird. Note that there are various methods and tools for waking up your computer automatically at a pre-specified time, in case you don&#8217;t want to keep it running constantly until it&#8217;s time to send the messages. For Windows, for example, see: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifsoft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[1]<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vistax64.com\/tutorials\/166809-task-scheduler-wake-up-computer.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[2]<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/158142\/Schedule_your_PCs_Startup_and_Program_Launch.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[3]<\/a>.

You can schedule your Mac to wake up automatically by opening System Preferences and clicking on &#8220;Energy Saver&#8221; and then &#8220;Schedule&#8221;. Alternatively, see <a href=\"#server-side\">below<\/a> for a description of how to run Thunderbird on a server to deliver your messages for you.<\/p>\n<p>Or you can consider using a third-party service that holds and delivers scheduled messages for you, instead of Send Later.

Unfortunately, fixing this requires significant changes to the internal architecture for how scheduled messages are sent, and the changes are difficult since the core Thunderbird components involved are completely undocumented, so I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll be able to find the time to fix the problem.&nbsp;In the meantime, here&#8217;s a workaround (thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/email.about.com\/od\/mozillathunderbirdtips\/qt\/Add_an_Arbitrary_Custom_Header_to_Mozilla_Thunderbird.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">about.com<\/a>):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Thunderbird options dialog with Tools &gt; Options&#8230; or Edit &gt; Preferences&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><a name=\"config-editor\"><\/a>Click &#8220;Advanced&#8221; and then &#8220;Config Editor&#8230;&#8221; and click the &#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful, I promise!&#8221; button if it asks you to.<\/li>\n<li>Enter &#8220;mail.compose.other.header&#8221; in the filter box.<\/li>\n<li>Double-click on the mail.compose.other.header setting and set it to &#8220;Disposition-Notification-To&#8221;. If it already has a non-empty value, add a comma and then &#8220;Disposition-Notification-To&#8221; to the end of it.<\/li>\n<li>Quit from and restart Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<li>When you are composing a message for which you want a return receipt and which you want to schedule to be sent later, then click on an empty line in the message header in the compose window, select &#8220;Disposition-Notification-To&#8221; in the drop-down, and then enter your email address as the value of the header.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you want to automatically request a return receipt for <em>every<\/em> message you send, so that you don&#8217;t have to do it manually each time you schedule a message to be sent later, do the following (thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/kb.mozillazine.org\/Custom_headers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MozillaZine<\/a>):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the advanced configuration editor as described <a href=\"#config-editor\">above<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Enter &#8220;useremail&#8221; in the filter box and scan through the matches to find the email address of the account which you want to generate return receipts.

If not, then right-click in the settings area to create a new string setting with that name.<\/li>\n<li>Put &#8220;receipt&#8221; as the value of the setting if it&#8217;s empty, or append &#8220;,receipt&#8221; to the end of the existing value.<\/li>\n<li>Create a new string setting called &#8220;mail.identity.id<em>#<\/em>.header.receipt&#8221;, and set its value to &#8220;Disposition-Notification-To: <em>address<\/em>&#8220;, where <em>address<\/em> is the email address to which you would like return receipts sent.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><a id=\"windows-hangs\" href=\"#toc\">Thunderbird hangs frequently on Windows<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>A number of Send Later users on Windows have reported that when they have Send Later installed, Thunderbird periodically hangs for annoyingly long periods of time during normal use of the application.<\/p>\n<p>This is not actually a bug in Send Later &#8212; there is nothing Send Later does that should cause Thunderbird to hang, and some Thunderbird users on Windows have reported this issue even without Send Later installed &#8212; but whatever the problem is, Send Later does seem to exacerbate it for some people.<\/p>\n<p>I heard two different potential explanations for this behavior, one anecdotal (i.e., I have been unable to confirm it) and one definitive.<\/p>\n<p>First, the definitive one: If you have &#8220;Allow Windows Search to search messages&#8221; enabled in the General tab of your Thunderbird options, try turning it off and see if that solves the problem. It appears that the Windows Search indexer sometimes holds extended locks on files that Thunderbird uses, and Thunderbird hangs while waiting for the files to become available.<\/p>\n<p>The other possibility is that your real-time antivirus scanner&nbsp;is doing the same thing as the Windows Search indexer, i.e., holding a lock on a file that Thunderbird uses while scanning it for viruses. You can check if this is the case by temporarily disabling real-time protection and seeing if the Thunderbird hangs go away. The &#8220;temporarily&#8221; is important &#8212; you don&#8217;t want to permanently disable real-time protection, since it&#8217;s important to protect your computer from viruses!<\/p>\n<p>If this does turn out to be the problem, then the people who develop and support Thunderbird recommend excluding Thunderbird mailbox files from antivirus scanning, if your antivirus software has real-time protection (i.e., scans files when they are created, opened, or executed), as most modern antivirus software does. Their reasoning behind this recommendation is that mailbox files are never executed directly, so viruses lurking in mailbox files are not a threat. They only become a threat when they are saved separately by Thunderbird when you ask it to open or save an attachment. As long as your antivirus software scans those saved attachments in real-time, it is not dangerous to disable scanning of mailbox files. If you do decide to do this, then you need to identify the location of your Thunderbird profile folder, and tell your antivirus software to exclude the &#8220;ImapMail&#8221; and &#8220;Mail&#8221; subdirectories of that folder from scanning. You may also wish to exclude &#8220;global-messages-db.sqlite*&#8221; in that folder.<\/p>\n<p>Two notes about this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your antivirus software does not have real-time protection, or if it has it but you have it turned off, then I personally do&nbsp;<em>not<\/em> recommend excluding Thunderbird mailbox files from your scheduled antivirus scans.<\/li>\n<li>The recommendation above for excluding Thunderbird mailbox files from scans comes from the Thunderbird team, not from me. See <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues\">their wiki<\/a> for more information. I am not endorsing this recommendation; I&#8217;m just passing it on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Something to keep in mind is that the&nbsp;<em>size<\/em> of your Thunderbird files is contributing to the problem. Larger files take longer for antivirus products to scan. You may have large files in your Thunderbird profile for several reasons, including: you have folders containing many messages&nbsp;that you have configured to store local copies; you have many messages across your entire account and you have the global search feature enabled, since that means the global search index file will itself be very large; you have folders that haven&#8217;t been compacted in a very long time so they have a lot of wasted space in them their local storage files; you have an old Thunderbird profile which as a result has index files that have a lot of wasted space in them. Given these possibilities, here are some ideas that might help reduce the size of the files in your profile and thereby reduce the duration of hangs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>don&#8217;t store local copies of messages in folders whose messages you don&#8217;t access that often and don&#8217;t need to be able to full-text search;<\/li>\n<li>split up very large folders into multiple folders containing fewer messages (as I rule, I personally try not to let folders grow above 200MB; I find the <a href=\"https:\/\/freeshell.de\/~kaosmos\/index-en.html#foldersize\">ShowFolderSize extension<\/a> particularly useful for this);<\/li>\n<li>disable the global search index if you don&#8217;t use it;<\/li>\n<li>limit which folders are included in your global search results;<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/support.mozilla.org\/en-US\/kb\/rebuilding-global-database\">rebuild your global search index<\/a> periodically (follow the instructions in that link for locating the search index file, and check how large it is before and after you rebuild it, to see if rebuilding it actually reduces its size significantly and therefore makes this work continuing to do&nbsp;in the future);<\/li>\n<li>compact all your folders (File | Compact Folders); or<\/li>\n<li>worst-case scenario, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.mozilla.org\/en-US\/kb\/using-multiple-profiles\">rebuild your Thunderbird profile<\/a> to see if that helps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another option, which we list separately from the bulleted list above because it is still in the experimental phase (at least as of when this paragraph was written in September 2016), is to <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Thunderbird\/Maildir\">switch to Maildir storage<\/a>, which stores each incoming messages in a separate file. Be careful about this, however, because although it mostly works, as I just noted it isn&#8217;t yet fully supported.<\/p>\n<p>If you encounter this issue and come up with a solution that works and is different from the solutions outlined above, please <a href=\"mailto:send-later-support@extended-thunder.org?subject=Thunderbird%20hangs\">let us know<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"errors\" href=\"#toc\">Errors you might encounter<\/a><\/h3>\n<h4><a id=\"missing-drafts-folder\" href=\"#toc\">Missing drafts folder<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>If Thunderbird warns you repeatedly when Send Later is installed that you are missing a Drafts folder, you need to go through your accounts and make sure that the Drafts folder required by Thunderbird exists for all of them. Here&#8217;s the most reliable way to do that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a new message window.<\/li>\n<li>Type something random (doesn&#8217;t matter what) in the To and Subject fields of the message to ensure that it is a &#8220;valid&#8221; draft.<\/li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Save&#8221; button to save the draft.<\/li>\n<li>If you have multiple accounts, then change the &#8220;From&#8221; field of the draft one by one to each of the other accounts and click &#8220;Save&#8221; for each of them.<\/li>\n<li>When are done, close the window and delete the draft from the Drafts folder of the last account into which you saved it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><a id=\"outbox-copy-failure\" href=\"#toc\">&#8220;Error sending unsent messages&#8221;<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re reading this section, it&#8217;s probably because you got a pop-up alert that said this (or the equivalent in another language):<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Send Later: Error copying scheduled message to Outbox for delivery (code %x).

You should:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check your Outbox (under Local Folders) to see if there is a scheduled message stuck there waiting to be sent. If so, and the message looks complete, run run File &gt; Send Unsent Messages to send it. If the message looks incomplete, delete it.<\/li>\n<li>If there was no message in your Outbox, or if it was incomplete and you deleted it, then you&#8217;re probably fine. Restart Thunderbird to turn Send Later back on.<\/li>\n<li>Otherwise, check your Drafts folder to see if there&#8217;s another copy there of the message that you just sent from your Outbox, and if so, delete it from Drafts (unless it&#8217;s a recurring message, in which case you should open and reschedule it for the next time you want it to be sent).

Immediately after Send Later delivers the message, it calculates a new delivery time for it based on the frequency you specified and saves a new draft back into your Drafts folder with the new delivery time. This will continue for as long as you leave the message in your Drafts folder with recurrence enabled. To stop the message from being delivered anymore, remove it from your Drafts folder, or edit the draft and save it without scheduling.<\/p>\n<p>When you select one of the recurrence&nbsp;options, the Send Later dialog changes slightly to&nbsp;look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4612 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/Send-this-email-later_007.png?resize=579%2C475&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"579\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/Send-this-email-later_007.png?w=579&amp;ssl=1 579w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/Send-this-email-later_007.png?resize=300%2C246&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new controls that appear in the dialog, shown circled in red above, are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the &#8220;Every&#8221; checkbox to specify a multiplier other than 1, the default, to indicate how many time periods should be skipped between deliveries. For example, every 2 days, every 4 weeks, etc.<\/li>\n<li>When you are using &#8220;monthly&#8221; recurrence only, you can check the &#8220;week of the month&#8221; checkbox to be sent the same weekday of the week of every month, e.g., &#8220;4th Tuesday of the month.&#8221; To do this, first enter the first scheduled date\/time in the text box, then select &#8220;monthly&#8221;, then check the box next to &#8220;4th Tuesday of the month&#8221; (or whatever &#8212; the text is updated automatically based on the first scheduled date\/time).<\/li>\n<li>If you check &#8220;Cancel recurrence upon reply&#8221;, then Send Later watches for incoming messages that are replies to recurring messages you&#8217;ve scheduled, and if a reply is received, then Send Later automatically deletes the recurring message from your Drafts folder.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some things to keep in mind about recurring messages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can&#8217;t use the preset buttons to schedule recurring messages, i.e., you have to explicitly specify the first delivery time for the message in the controls at the top of the pop-up window. To make this clear, when you select recurrence in the pop-up, the preset buttons are automatically disabled.<\/li>\n<li>You can&#8217;t use the toolbar to schedule recurring messages. Also, if you edit a draft that was previously scheduled with recurrence, the toolbar buttons are disabled and you need to use the pop-up to reschedule it.<\/li>\n<li>If you schedule a monthly message for the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month, then there will be months in which it will actually be sent on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the <em>next<\/em> month. For example, if you schedule a message for the 30th, then on February in a leap year it will be sent on March 1 and again on March 30, and on February in a non-leap year it will be sent on March 2 and again on March 30. The day of the month on which you originally scheduled it will be preserved, so it&#8217;ll always be sent on that day in months which actually have it.<\/li>\n<li>Similarly, if you schedule a yearly message on February 29, then it&#8217;ll be delivered on March 1 in non-leap years.<\/li>\n<li>If several scheduled send times for a message pass without Thunderbird being running, then the next time you run Thunderbird, it&#8217;ll only send the messages once for that interval. For example, if you have a daily message scheduled, and you leave Thunderbird shut down for a week, then when you start it up, it&#8217;ll only send one copy of that message instead of seven, and then reschedule it for delivery again tomorrow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Time\/date restrictions on recurring messages<\/h4>\n<p>When you schedule a recurring message, you can optionally enable restrictions on the time of day and day of week when the message is delivered. By default, these restrictions are enforced when each recurring instance of the message is scheduled but&nbsp;<em>not<\/em> when it is delivered, so if a message is delivered late because Thunderbird wasn&#8217;t running or your computer was asleep at the messages scheduled time, then the message will be sent immediately when Thunderbird wakes up even if the current time falls outside the time or weekday restrictions. If you would like these&nbsp;restrictions to be enforced at delivery time as well, <a href=\"#prefs\">there&#8217;s a preference for that<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"mailmerge\" href=\"#toc\">Mail Merge add-on<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/mail-merge\/\">Mail Merge add-on<\/a> supports Send Later starting with its version 3.4.0. The following documentation for using Send Later with Mail Merge is courtesy of Mail Merge&#8217;s author, Alexander Bergmann. Thanks very much to Alexander for adding this feature, which has been requested by many users, to his add-on! Mail Merge has a &#8220;Date&#8221; field in the Mail Merge Dialog as part of the &#8220;Mail&#8221; section, which is visible if the user selects &#8220;Save As Draft&#8221; as &#8220;Deliver Mode&#8221; and Send Later is installed and activated. If you put a valid date in the &#8220;Date&#8221; field, then Mail Merge will tell Send Later to deliver the message at the specified date, just as if you scheduled it with Send Later directly. The &#8220;Date&#8221; field also supports variables! So it is possible to use a column &#8220;Date&#8221; (or &#8220;Time&#8221; or whatever you like to name it) with different dates for each recipient in the CSV. (Or if you want to use the Address Book, you probably will want to use Custom1 to Custom4 for this purpose.) In the &#8220;Date&#8221; field of the Mail Merge Dialog, you usually want to use something like this:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">{{Date}} {{Time}} (There are probably other use cases with different variables as well.)<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"owl\" href=\"#toc\">Owl for Exchange add-on<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/owl-for-exchange\/\">Owl for Exchange<\/a> add-on allows Thunderbird to send and receive email through a Microsoft Exchange Server account. Send Later can be made to work with Owl for Exchange, but only if you configure an SMTP server for outbound messages. Please read on for an explanation and additional details.<\/p>\n<p>When you configure a &#8220;normal&#8221; (i.e., not Exchange) internet email account in Thunderbird you specify two servers for the account: the inbound server, an IMAP or POP3 server, where your email should be fetched from, and the outbound server, an SMTP server, through which the messages you compose are delivered.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft Exchange does support IMAP and SMTP, so if the administrator or your Exchange server has enabled them, you could configure Thunderbird to treat your Exchange server as a normal internet email account and not use Owl. However, you may need to use if your administrator has not enabled IMAP and SMTP, or you want to take advantage of additional Owl features such as its Exchange address book integration.<\/p>\n<p>The code for the Thunderbird message compose window knows how to send messages via Owl, so when you compose a message interactively and click the Send button it is sent successfully. However, the code that delivers message via the Thunderbird Outbox code does <em>not<\/em> know how to send messages via Owl, so when an Owl message is put into your Outbox and then Thunderbird tries to deliver it, it doesn&#8217;t work. Unfortunately, Send Later uses the Outbox to deliver messages.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a workaround. SMTP servers can be configured in Thunderbird independent of email accounts, so if you have access to an SMTP server &#8212; either because your Exchange administrator has enabled SMTP on the server, or because there is some other SMTP server you use &#8212; then Thunderbird can use that SMTP server to deliver Owl messages, and all is well. Well, sort of. There are some caveats you need to be aware of.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: <\/strong>Because email messages sent interactively through Owl go directly through Exchange while messages sent through Send Later go through SMTP, the headers of the two messages will be different an an astute observer will be able to figure out through deductive reasoning and a careful examination of the headers that the message was sent by Send Later, i.e., that it was not written at the time it was sent. Depending on why you are using Send Later to delay messages, this may or may not be something you care about.<\/p>\n<p>If you have multiple email accounts configured in Thunderbird, some of which are Owl accounts and some of which are IMAP\/SMTP accounts, and you don&#8217;t do anything special to configure your Owl account for SMTP, then when you send a message via Send Later&nbsp;Thunderbird will deliver it through your default SMTP server, which is usually the first SMTP server that was added to your Thunderbird profile. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new Thunderbird profile.<\/li>\n<li>Add account A, an Owl account, to the profile.<\/li>\n<li>Add account B, an IMAP\/SMTP account.<\/li>\n<li>Add account C, an IMAP\/SMTP account.<\/li>\n<li>Schedule a message from your Owl account via Send Later.<\/li>\n<li>At the scheduled delivery time, the message will be sent via the SMTP server for account B.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The SMTP server may not allow the message to be sent through it if the sender address doesn&#8217;t match the domain the SMTP server is intended to be used for. In that case the SMTP server will reject the message and the send will fail. Obviously, for Owl and Send Later to work you need to use an SMTP server that will allow you to send messages from your Owl email address through it.<\/p>\n<p>To add an SMTP server to your Thunderbird profile independent of adding a full email account:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Account Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Outgoing Server (SMTP)&#8221; on the left.<\/li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Add&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Fill out the server details and click &#8220;OK&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If this is the only SMTP server in your profile, it will become the default and will be used for Owl messages sent via Send Later. The first time a message is sent that way you will be prompted for the server password, and you should tell Thunderbird to save it if you want Thunderbird to be able to send scheduled messages in the future without prompting you for a password.<\/p>\n<p>To change which SMTP server your Owl account uses for Send Later messages:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Account Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Manage Identities&#8230;&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Select the identity for your Owl account and click &#8220;Edit&#8230;&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Near the bottom of the window where it says &#8220;Outgoing Server (SMTP)&#8221;, click on the pop-up menu and select the SMTP server you want to use.<\/li>\n<li>Click &#8220;OK&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><a id=\"dynamic\" href=\"#toc\">Dynamic functions for complex scheduling rules<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The scheduling functionality built into Send Later is quite flexible, but sometimes you may want to implement more complex scheduling rules.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the most common request I&#8217;ve received is for Send Later to have a button which tells it, &#8220;Send this message at the start of the next work day,&#8221; so that people can do work during off hours without their clients \/ customers \/ colleagues knowing that they&#8217;re doing so.<\/p>\n<p>To satisfy this need, Send Later allows you to write your own code &#8212; or import code written by others &#8212; that implements arbitrarily complex scheduling rules. These scheduling rules are called dynamic functions, and you manage them in the dynamic function editor, which you can open either from the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab of the Send Later preferences window, or from the context menu that pops up when you click on &#8220;Send Later&#8221; in the status bar of the main Thunderbird window.<\/p>\n<p>The first time you open the editor, it will create and display a sample scheduling function called &#8220;ReadMeFirst&#8221; which has a big comment in it explaining more about what your code needs to do. It will also create two other sample functions, &#8220;BusinessHours&#8221; and &#8220;DaysInARow&#8221;, which you can play with to learn about how dynamic functions work.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the &#8220;BusinessHours&#8221; function is an implementation of the &#8220;Send this message at the start of the next work day&#8221; logic I&#8217;ve been asked for so many times!<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry&#8230; If you accidentally delete or mess up one of these files, you can restore it by downloading and saving it from here, importing the downloaded file into the editor, and saving:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ReadMeFirst.slj\">ReadMeFirst<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/BusinessHours.slj\">BusinessHours<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/DaysInARow.slj\">DaysInARow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to use a dynamic function once it&#8217;s ready to go.<\/p>\n<p>First, you can pick the function you want to use from the &#8220;function&#8221; pop-up menu in the Send Later dialog &#8220;<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(1)<\/span>&#8221; in the picture below). As you hover over the function names in the menu, the help text&nbsp;for each function is displayed to assist you in picking the right function. Furthermore, when you select a specific function, a help icon <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(2)<\/span> appears next to the menu with the help text for the function you selected bound to it for easy reference.<\/p>\n<p>You can apply time-of-day and day-of-week restrictions to functions in the dialog <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(3)<\/span>. Furthermore, some functions (including &#8220;BusinessHours&#8221;) accept arguments to customize their behavior, and you can specify those arguments in the text field provided <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(4)<\/span>, which is hidden until&nbsp;you select the &#8220;function&#8221; option.<\/p>\n<p>To see&nbsp;what the function&#8217;s calculations will yield before actually sending the message, click the &#8220;Calculate&#8221; button <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(5)<\/span>, and the function, restrictions, and arguments you specified are executed and the result appears in the &#8220;Send at&#8221; box.&nbsp;<em>You don&#8217;t&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>need<\/em><\/strong><em> to push the &#8220;Calculate&#8221; button before sending your message,&nbsp;<\/em>you can just click the big &#8220;Send according to function&#8221; button <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(6)<\/span> and the right thing will happen. In fact, Send Later&nbsp;<em>does the calculations again<\/em> when you click the big button, even if you previously clicked &#8220;Calculate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As noted above, if you&nbsp;need to use the same settings repeatedly, you can select &#8220;Save these values as the defaults&#8221; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(7)<\/span> so you don&#8217;t have to enter them over and over; this works for scheduling with functions just like it does for entering a single send time explicitly or using one of the recurrence options.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, a picture is worth a thousand words:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4384\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/Send-this-email-later_010.jpg?resize=300%2C229&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Send this email later_010\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><\/p>\n<p>The other way you can use dynamic functions is by binding them to one or more of the shortcut buttons. In the Preferences tab for one of the shortcut buttons, enter &#8220;ufunc:<em>name<\/em>&#8221; where&nbsp;<em>name<\/em> is the name of the function you want to bind to that shortcut. Don&#8217;t forget to change the button label too!<\/p>\n<p>You can even specify arguments to be passed to the function. For example if you specify &#8220;ufunc:BusinessHours([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [9, 0], [17, 0])&#8221;, then that shortcut button will schedule messages to be sent between 9:00am and 5:00pm Sunday through Thursday (see the help text for the BusinessHours function for an explanation of how to interpret those arguments).<\/p>\n<p>You may not need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jikamens\/send-later\/tree\/master\/contrib\/scheduling-functions\">library of dynamic functions<\/a> contributed by other Send Later users. Also, consider sharing the functions you create! That page has instructions there for adding to the library.<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"dynamic-recurrence\" href=\"#toc\">Dynamic recurrence<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>In addition to supporting arbitrary logic for scheduling a message once, dynamic functions can also support arbitrary logic for sending messages multiple times, i.e., for recurring messages. This is very powerful functionality, but it&#8217;s also a bit complicated, so bear with me while I walk you through it.<\/p>\n<p>A dynamic function&nbsp;implements recurrence by putting&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>recurrence specification string&nbsp;<\/em>in the &#8220;nextspec&#8221; variable before the function returns. The recurrence specification does one of two things: either it specifies a recurrence type that Send Later knows how to handle internally, after which the dynamic function is &#8220;out of the loop&#8221; for subsequent deliveries of the message and doesn&#8217;t get called again; or it tells Send Later to continue calling it each time the message needs to be rescheduled.<\/p>\n<p>The internal recurrence types, which correspond to the options in the Send Later dialog, are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>minutely &#8211; <\/strong>Send the message every minute.<\/li>\n<li><strong>daily<\/strong> &#8211; Send the message once per day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>weekly<\/strong> &#8211; Send the message once per week.<\/li>\n<li><strong>monthly <em>day-of-month<\/em><\/strong> &#8211; Send the message on the specified day of every month.<\/li>\n<li><strong>monthly <em>day-of-week<\/em> <em>week-of-month<\/em><\/strong> &#8211; Send the message on the specified day (0 = Sunday &#8211; 6 = Saturday) of the specified week of the month. For example, &#8220;monthly 1 3&#8221; means to send the message on the third Monday of every month.<\/li>\n<li><strong>yearly <em>month day<\/em><\/strong>&#8211; Send the message on the specified day of every month (0 = January &#8211; 11 = December). For example, &#8220;yearly 10 5&#8221; means November 5 of every year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, after one of the primary recurrence specifications shown above, the function can include any of&nbsp;the following modifiers in the specification string:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8221; \/&nbsp;<em>number<\/em>&#8221; (that&#8217;s a space, then a slash, then another space, then a number &#8212; the syntax is important!) to indicate&nbsp;every&nbsp;<em>number<\/em> minutes, e.g., &#8220;<strong>minutely \/ 20<\/strong>&#8221; means every 20 minutes;<\/li>\n<li>&#8221; between&nbsp;<em>YYMM YYMM<\/em>&#8221; to indicate a time restriction; and<\/li>\n<li>&#8221; on&nbsp;<em>d1 d2 &#8230;<\/em>&#8221; to indicate a day-of-week restriction, where &#8220;<em>d1 d2 &#8230;<\/em>&#8221; is a list of space-separated day numbers, .with the numbering starting with 0 for Sunday.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If, on the other hand, your function wants Send Later to call it repeatedly to do the scheduling, then it should set &#8220;nextspec&#8221; to <strong>&#8220;function &#8221; + specname<\/strong>. This specification string can also use the &#8220;between&#8221; and &#8220;on&#8221; modifiers shown above, but not the &#8220;\/&#8221; modifier.<\/p>\n<p>If your function takes arguments that control its behavior and\/or keeps state between invocations, then those need to be assigned as an array to the &#8220;nextargs&#8221; variable before your function returns.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways for a recurring dynamic function to stop sending a recurring message:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the function knows that the message it was just asked to schedule is the last one, then it should&nbsp;simply not set &#8220;nextspec&#8221; to anything (i.e., leave it null), and Send Later will use the final send time it provided and then not schedule the message any further; or<\/li>\n<li>if the function determines that the current invocation is too late to send the message any more, i.e., it wants to stop the message&nbsp;immediately rather than after the next time it is sent, then it should&nbsp;set &#8220;next&#8221; to -1 and not set &#8220;nextspec&#8221; to anything, and Send Later will stop the message immediately.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a id=\"senddrafts\" href=\"#toc\">Suppressing scheduled message delivery<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>If you set the preference &#8220;extensions.sendlater3.senddrafts&#8221; to false in the advanced config editor (described <a href=\"#config-editor\">above<\/a>), then Send Later won&#8217;t deliver scheduled drafts when their time comes; it&#8217;ll just leave them in your Drafts folder as if their delivery time has not yet arrived. In case you are wondering what use this might have&#8230; One clever Send Later user decided to eliminate the requirement for Thunderbird to be running all the time to deliver scheduled messages, by writing an independent service to scan for and deliver scheduled messages from his IMAP Drafts folder. Unfortunately, if he happened to be running Thunderbird when a draft was scheduled to be sent, his Thunderbird and his service might have tried to deliver the same draft at the same time, thus causing unpredictable behavior and\/or duplicate messages. He can avoid this issue by setting the &#8220;senddrafts&#8221; preference to false.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"server-side\" href=\"#toc\">Server-side Send Later<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><em>(This is very advanced usage. It can be complicated to set up, and things could go embarrassingly wrong if you mess it up. Proceed at your own risk.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you want scheduled drafts to be sent even when your computer is shut down or Thunderbird isn&#8217;t running, and you have access to a server somewhere on which you can keep Thunderbird running all the time, here&#8217;s how you can set things up to have scheduled messages sent via that server.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use IMAP, not POP3, to access the email account in question. Otherwise, Thunderbird can&#8217;t store your scheduled drafts on the mail server and the server-side Thunderbird won&#8217;t be able to read and send them.<\/li>\n<li>Install Thunderbird on the server.<\/li>\n<li>If you can, set up the server to log you in automatically when it reboots, to start Thunderbird automatically when you log in, etc. I.e., do as much as you can to ensure that Thunderbird will stay running all the time.<\/li>\n<li>Configure your email account into Thunderbird on the server.&nbsp;<b>Important: <\/b>see <a href=\"#matching-accounts\">below<\/a> for a very important note about configuring accounts and identities on different computers.<\/li>\n<li>On the client, set extensions.sendlater3.senddrafts to false as described <a href=\"#senddrafts\">above<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>On the client, use the advanced config editor to find the value of the preference extensions.sendlater3.instance.uuid. Copy the value into a text file or save it in some other way.<\/li>\n<li>On the server, use the advanced config editor to set extensions.sendlater3.instance.uuid to the value you copied from the client.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After you follow these steps, the client will stop sending out scheduled messages, and the server will start sending them out instead, since you&#8217;ve tricked it into thinking it is the same &#8220;instance&#8221; of Send Later as the client.<\/p>\n<div>If you use Send Later on multiple clients, e.g., on a desktop and a laptop, then you can make the value of extensions.sendlater3.instance.uuid the same on all of them, as long as extensions.sendlater3.senddrafts is only set to true in one Thunderbird, i.e., the one that you keep running all the time.<\/div>\n<p>Remember that this only works if Thunderbird stays running on the server. Don&#8217;t forget to keep an eye on it and restart it if it shuts down. If you want to be especially careful, you can schedule a <a href=\"#recurring\">recurring message<\/a> to yourself as a simple monitor &#8212; if you don&#8217;t receive the recurring message at the scheduled time, you know that Thunderbird on the server has stopped running and you can log in and restart it.<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"matching-accounts\"><\/a>Accounts and identities on different computers<\/h4>\n<p>When you compose a draft message, Thunderbird inserts special, hidden settings into the message indicating the account and identity used to compose the draft. Although you don&#8217;t see them in the user interface, Thunderbird assigns numerical identifiers to accounts and identities; these numerical identifiers are what gets put into the hidden settings in the draft message. You can see these identifiers by looking in your prefs.js file (Help | Troubleshooting Information, click on the button to open your profile directory, and load the file &#8220;prefs.js&#8221; in that directory into a text editor) for lines containing &#8220;mail.identity.id&#8221; and &#8220;mail.account.account&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>When you only use Thunderbird on one machine, you never have to worry about what those hidden identifiers are. However, when you try to share accounts between multiple Thunderbird installations,&nbsp;and you have more than one account and\/or identity configured, then&nbsp;you will run into problems if the identifiers for the accounts and identifiers are different. In particular, if you configure things as described above to schedule messages from one computer and send them from another, and the account or&nbsp;identity numbers don&#8217;t match on the two computers,&nbsp;<em>then the scheduled messages will be sent from the wrong identity and\/or account.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are several&nbsp;ways to avoid this problem:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back up your Thunderbird profile from one computer and restore it on the other, thus guaranteeing that the account and identity configuration on the two computers will match. This is harder than it sounds because there are file paths hard-coded in various locations in your profile, mostly in prefs.js, that will ned to be updated if your profile is in a different directory on the second computer. A tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/mozbackup.jasnapaka.com\/\">MozBackup<\/a> may help with this, but it only runs on Windows and it may not fix everything it needs to when the profile is restored.<\/li>\n<li>Create a new Thunderbird profile on the second computer, then quit out of Thunderbird there without configuring any accounts, load the new profile&#8217;s prefs.js into a text editor, and copy all the mail.account*, mail.identity.*, mail.server.*, and mail.smtp*, lines from your old prefs.js file to&nbsp;the new one, omitting any lines that have hard-coded file paths in them. Then restart Thunderbird on the new computer and log into all the accounts and send test messages from all your identities so that Thunderbird&#8217;s password manager can save all the necessary passwords.<\/li>\n<li>Edit prefs.js by hand (with Thunderbird not running!) on one of the computers to swap around the numbers for all the accounts, identities, servers, and SMTP servers so they match the numbers on the other computers.&nbsp;<em>Editing prefs.js is dangerous, and this is not for the faint of heart, and make sure you save a backup copy you can restore if you screw things up!<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><a id=\"dynamic_sendbutton\" href=\"#toc\">Making &#8220;Send&#8221; do &#8220;Send Later&#8221; only some of the time<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>You may be in a situation where some of the time, you want to make sure to schedule every message you send, while other times, you want to send messages right away. For example, you might catch up on work late at night, but letting your clients know that might give them the incorrect impression that you don&#8217;t mind if they call you at god-awful hours :-). With Send Later and userChromeJS, we can make that happen.<\/p>\n<p>The userChromeJS add-on allows you to add arbitrary JavaScript code and functions to your Thunderbird installation. Here&#8217;s how you do that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the <a href=\"http:\/\/userchromejs.mozdev.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">userChromeJS add-on<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Find the userChrome.js file created by userChromeJS. It will be in the \u201cchrome\u201d subfolder of your <a href=\"http:\/\/kb.mozillazine.org\/Profile_folder_-_Thunderbird\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thunderbird profile folder<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Using your favorite text editor, add the code you want to userChrome.js, then exit from and restart Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of code you can put in userChrome.js to solve the problem above, i.e., you want the &#8220;Send&#8221; button to do &#8220;Send Later&#8221; after hours:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"font-size: 125%;\">\/\/ Set up a timer to call a function every five minutes to check\n\/\/ whether we want the \"Send\" button to actually do \"Send Later\".\n\n\/\/ This is the function that the timer will call.\nvar SendButtonPrefCallback = {\n    notify: function(timer) {\n\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\/\/ Sunday or Saturday\n\tvar weekend = now.getDay() == 0 || now.getDay() == 6;\n\t\/\/ Before 9am\n\tvar early = now.getHours() &lt; 9;\n \t\/\/ After 5pm\n \tvar late = now.getHours() &gt; 4;\n\t\/\/ Put it all togther\n\tvar do_popup = weekend || early || late;\n\t\/\/ Set the appropriate Send Later preference\n\tvar prefService = Components\n\t    .classes[\"@mozilla.org\/preferences-service;1\"]\n\t    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPrefBranch);\n\tprefService.setBoolPref(\"extensions.sendlater3.sendbutton\", do_popup);\n    }\n}\n\n\/\/ This is the variable that the timer will be stored in.\nvar SendButtonPrefTimer = null;\n\n\/\/ Now set up the timer.\nif (!

For example, if you want it to check every 15 seconds, change it to 15000.<\/li>\n<li>Double click on the second displayed preference, the &#8220;is_milliseconds&#8221; preference, to change it from false to true.<\/li>\n<li>Restart Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Important notes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the delay between scans too low could cause the add-on to become confused. Fifteen seconds is probably pretty safe. Five seconds may even be safe, though it&#8217;s pushing it. Less than five seconds is probably a bad idea.<\/li>\n<li>Whatever check frequency you configure, a scheduled message could be sent up to that many seconds later than it was actually scheduled. For example, if you&#8217;re checking every 15 seconds, messages could end up being sent up to 15 seconds after their scheduled send times.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that once Send Later decides to put the message into your Outbox and tell Thunderbird to send it, the actual transmitting of the message takes a bit of time as well, especially if it&#8217;s large.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"troubleshooting\" href=\"#toc\">Troubleshooting<\/a><\/h2>\n<h3><a id=\"outbox\" href=\"#toc\">Messages don&#8217;t send or send multiple times<\/a><\/h3>\n<h4>Are you using the add-on correctly?<\/h4>\n<p>If scheduled messages get moved into your Outbox (underneath Local Folders) at the scheduled send time but don&#8217;t get delivered from there, then the first thing to do is confirm that you haven&#8217;t <em>told<\/em> Send Later not to deliver messages. Open Send Later&#8217;s preferences (click &#8220;Send Later&#8221; at the bottom of the main window and select &#8220;Send Later preferences&#8221; from the menu) and make sure the box next to &#8220;Trigger unsent message delivery from Outbox&#8221; is checked. It is checked by default, so if it isn&#8217;t, then you unchecked it for some reason, and you should check it and click &#8220;OK&#8221; to save the change. Then, to cause past messages that were previously put into the Outbox to be delivered, select the &#8220;File | Send Unsent Messages&#8221; menu command. If that&#8217;s not the problem, then read on.<\/p>\n<p>Another common mistake when using the add-on is clicking on the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button rather than the &#8220;Send by&#8221; button. As documented above, the button that actually causes a message to be scheduled for later delivery is this one:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/send_button.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5763 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/send_button.png?resize=300%2C230&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/send_button.png?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/send_button.png?resize=660%2C505&amp;ssl=1 660w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.kamens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/send_button.png?w=664&amp;ssl=1 664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you instead click the &#8216;Put in Outbox&#8221; button below it, then you&#8217;re not scheduling the message for later delivery, you&#8217;re putting it directly into the Outbox to be sent the next time you do &#8220;File | Send Unsent Messages&#8221; or the next time Send Later delivers a separate scheduled message, since every time Send Later delivers a message, <em>all<\/em> pending messages in the Outbox are delivered.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you are using the add-on properly and its preferences are set correctly before proceeding with the following troubleshooting steps.<\/p>\n<p>If scheduled messages are going into your Drafts folder but not moving into your Outbox at the scheduled time, then check if your mail server is discarding the Send Later headers, as described <a href=\"#bad-mail-servers\">above<\/a>. If not, then proceed with the following troubleshooting steps.<\/p>\n<h4>Messages not being sent: isolating the problem<\/h4>\n<p>If Send Later fails to deliver messages at the scheduled time, or if scheduled messages are delivered repeatedly, the two most likely causes are corrupt Drafts folders and a corrupted Outbox folder. A corrupted Outbox may even cause Thunderbird to crash when it tries to deliver scheduled messages. Note that corrupted folders are <em>not<\/em> Send Later&#8217;s fault&#8230; There are bugs in other parts of Thunderbird, which can cause folders to become corrupted.<\/p>\n<p>If your messages aren&#8217;t being delivered properly, then please perform the following two diagnostic tests to isolate exactly where the problem lies:<\/p>\n<h5>Test #1<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Disable the Send Later add-on.<\/li>\n<li>Restart Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<li>Compose a new message with a valid recipient, Subject, and message body.<\/li>\n<li>Select the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; command on the &#8220;File&#8221; menu of the composition window.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you get an error at this point, then&nbsp;<em>Send Later is not the problem.<\/em> Rather, one of the following is wrong:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>corrupt Outbox folder &#8212; see <a href=\"#corrupt-outbox\">below<\/a> for how to repair it;<\/li>\n<li>full Windows temporary directory &#8212; see <a href=\"#wintemp\">below<\/a> for how to repair it;<\/li>\n<li>your hard disk is full; or<\/li>\n<li>something is broken in your Thunderbird profile &#8212; unfortunately the only way I&#8217;ve been able to find to resolve this is to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.mozilla.org\/en-US\/kb\/using-multiple-profiles\">migrate to a new Thunderbird profile<\/a>&nbsp;and get rid of the old one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Test #2<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with a successful Test #1, above.<\/li>\n<li>Check the &#8220;Outbox&#8221; folder underneath &#8220;Local Folders&#8221; and confirm that the message you composed is there.<\/li>\n<li>Select the &#8220;Send Unsent Messages&#8221; command under the &#8220;File&#8221; menu in the main Thunderbird window and confirm that the message in your Outbox folder is sent successfully.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If the &#8220;Send Unsent Messages&#8221; command is grayed out in the menu, i.e., you cannot execute it even though there is a message in the Outbox, or if the message does not send successfully when you execute this command, ,then&nbsp;<em>Send Later is not the problem.<\/em> Rather, one of the problems and solutions listed above in &#8220;Test #1&#8221; applies.<\/p>\n<h5>Test #3<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with successful Tests #1 and #2 above.<\/li>\n<li>Re-enable the Send Later add-on and restart Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<li>Compose a new message with a valid recipient, Subject, and message body.<\/li>\n<li>Schedule the message with Send Later to be sent five minutes in the future.<\/li>\n<li>Confirm that the message is saved to your Drafts folder.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If, instead of the message being saved into the Drafts folder, you get an error, then try repairing your Drafts folder and then repeat this test.

Here&#8217;s how to do that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure the &#8220;Outbox&#8221; folder under &#8220;Local Folders&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have any messages in it (because we&#8217;re about to delete the folder). If it does, and you want to save them, move them into your Drafts folder to be resent later.<\/li>\n<li>Right-click (on Mac, perhaps ctrl-click) on &#8220;Local Folders&#8221; and select &#8220;Settings&#8230;&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Note the directory in which your local folders are stored.<\/li>\n<li>Browse to that directory.<\/li>\n<li>Exit completely from Thunderbird.<\/li>\n<li>Delete Outbox and Outbox.msf in the Local Folders directory if they exist. Also delete &#8220;Unsent Messages&#8221; and &#8220;Unsent Messages.msf&#8221; if they exist. If neither of them exists, then you&#8217;ll have to use the advanced configuration editor (described <a href=\"#config-editor\">above<\/a>) in Thunderbird and look at the setting mail.default_sendlater_uri to find out the name of your Outbox folder on disk and then delete it (after exiting again from Thunderbird).<\/li>\n<li>Try scheduling a message with Send Later again and see if the problem is gone.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><a id=\"drafts-cleanup\"><\/a>Corrupt Drafts folders<\/h4>\n<p>A good sign that one of your Drafts folders is corrupted is if Send Later isn&#8217;t noticing that there are scheduled messages, i.e., the message at the bottom of your Thunderbird window says &#8220;IDLE&#8221; instead of &#8220;PEND 1&#8221;, &#8220;PEND 2&#8221;, etc. However, if messages aren&#8217;t getting sent at the scheduled time, then you may still have a corrupted Drafts folder even if the message says &#8220;PEND&#8221;. You need to repair them all:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate the Drafts folders for all of your accounts. The easiest way to do that, if you have multiple accounts, is to switch to the unified folder view (View | Folders | Unified) and expand &#8220;Drafts&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Right click on each one and select &#8220;Properties&#8230;&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Repair Folder&#8221; button in each Properties window, then click &#8220;OK&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> Repairing a folder resets its visible columns, column layout, and sorting, so if you&#8217;ve customized the columns and\/or sorting, you&#8217;ll have to put the customizations back after repairing the folders.<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"wintemp\"><\/a>Full temporary directory on Windows<\/h4>\n<p>If your Windows temporary directory ends up with too many files in it, which is partially Thunderbird&#8217;s fault since it has a habit of creating temporary files and not deleting them, then both Send Later and Thunderbird may start malfunctioning. The two surefire signs of this are, (a) Send Later is able to copy messages into your Outbox for delivery, but once they&#8217;re there, Thunderbird fails to deliver them, and (b) when there are messages in your Outbox, the File | Send Unsent Messages command doesn&#8217;t work, or is greyed out and can&#8217;t even be selected. If you this you may be running into this problem, you should run the Windows Disk Cleanup utility and tell it to clean up temporary files.<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"gmail\"><\/a>Send errors with Gmail when Thunderbird is configured to save copies<\/h4>\n<p>Many users of Send Later report errors when the add-on attempts to send scheduled messages through a Gmail account. These errors happen more often, but not only, when Send Later attempts to deliver multiple messages at the same time. This is usually caused by an error in the Thunderbird configuration for the Gmail account. In particular, it is not necessary to configure Thunderbird to save copies of sent messages in Gmail&#8217;s Sent Mail folder, since Gmail saves copies there automatically (this is documented in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/mail\/answer\/78892\">Google&#8217;s configuration instructions<\/a> for Thunderbird). When Thunderbird <em>is <\/em>incorrectly configured to save copies, it can cause message delivery errors. When this occurs, the delivery error happens after the message is sent to its recipients, when the copy is being saved in Sent Mail. This could potentially cause the recipients to receive multiple copies of the message, since if the user then tells Thunderbird to try sending it again, it might re-attempt the entire delivery, not just the saving in Sent Mail. Therefore, if you are experiencing errors with Send Later through a Gmail account, check your account settings to see if you have &#8220;Place a copy in&#8221; checked in the &#8220;Copies &amp; Folders&#8221; settings, and if so, turn it off.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"debug\" href=\"#toc\">Debug logging<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>If you ask us for help with a problem you are having with the add-on that we can&#8217;t reproduce ourselves, then we may ask you to enable debug logging on the add-on, perform some task with debug logging enabled, and then send us the resulting debug log.

Starting in 7.3.0 we were doing a better job of selecting the language for parsing dates, so we started actually trying to parse dates in Polish, which caused the hidden bug to show up.<\/p>\n<p>In this release we patch that bug, so now Polish users of the add-on should be able to type dates into the prompt window.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.3.0\"><\/a>Release 7.3.0 (November 20, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Fix date-parsing for non-English locales (again)<\/p>\n<p>The previous fix for Thunderbird 68 to make Send Later determine the correct locale to parse dates in apparently broke before Thunderbird 68 actually shipped, so an additional fix is called for.<\/p>\n<p>People using Thunderbird in a foreign language that Send Later knows how to parse should be able to type dates in that language again.<\/p>\n<p>This release also contains a small update to the Italian translation.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.2.1\"><\/a>Release 7.2.1 (November 5, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes in 7.2.1:<\/p>\n<p>Extra logging and error handling to work around an issue that seems to be cropping up for the first time in Thunderbird 68, preventing scheduled messages in some Drafts folders from being sent.<\/p>\n<p>Compatibility changes for Thunderbird 71+.<\/p>\n<p>Translation updates.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.2.0\"><\/a>Release 7.2.0 (September 23, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes in 7.2.0:<\/p>\n<p><strong>New feature: Support a simple n-minute delay for all sent messages<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can now configure Send Later (via its preferences) to schedule all messages which you send with the Send button or Ctrl-Enter to be delayed by a specified number of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this feature and the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; feature are incompatible so only one of them can be enabled at a time.<\/p>\n<p>This is the long-awaited replacement for the functionality of the old &#8220;BlunderDelay&#8221; Thunderbird extension.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bug fixes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The preferences window works in Thunderbird 71+ now.<\/p>\n<p>Some (but perhaps not all) instances of the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; column showing in folders where it shouldn&#8217;t have been fixed.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.1.3\"><\/a>Release 7.1.3 (September 18, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Fix a bug which has been preventing saving or removing dynamic scheduling functions from working since Thunderbird 68.<\/p>\n<p>Update translations.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.1.2\"><\/a>Release 7.1.2 (September 9, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 7.1.0 (7.1.1 was never released):<\/p>\n<p>Fix the OK, Cancel, and Reset buttons in the preferences window, which were broken in Thunderbird 68.<\/p>\n<p>Add a preference to allow the user to disable the Ctrl-Alt-1, -2, and -3 key bindings in the message composition window.<\/p>\n<p>Spread out the links at the bottom of the preferences window so they aren&#8217;t all scrunched together.<\/p>\n<p>Implement a compatibility fix for Thunderbird 70+ to make the toolbar buttons in the message composition window work properly again.<\/p>\n<p>Update some translations.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.1.0\"><\/a>Release 7.1.0 (September 6, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Welcome to the Send Later release notes!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Typically, these release notes only include changes since the most recent release. However, since some of you may have just upgraded from Thunderbird 60 to Thunderbird 68 and therefore made a big jump from Send Later 6.4.6 to 7.1.0, and since by default Send Later doesn&#8217;t display release notes for patch releases, it has been a while since Send Later has shown release notes to most of you. Therefore, these notes summarize what has changed between versions 6.4.6 and 7.1.0 of Send Later.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, significant modifications to Send Later were required to make it compatible with Thunderbird 68. These changes have been tested pretty extensively, but there may still be rough edges, so please make sure to let me know about any issues you encounter. You can either <a href=\"mailto:jik+sendlater3@kamens.us\">email me<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jikamens\/send-later\/issues\">post an issue on Github<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As you know, the Send Later window that pops up when you type Ctrl-Shift-Enter or select the &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221; menu command allows the date and time to send a message to be entered either by typing it out or by pointing and clicking at &#8220;datepicker&#8221; and &#8220;timepicker&#8221; widgets. However, due to changes in the version 68 of the Thunderbird application, the datepicker and timepicker are now only displayed if you have the &#8220;Lightning&#8221; add-on installed and enabled. This also means that you can&#8217;t set delivery time ranges in a message unless &#8220;Lightning&#8221; is there.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of that, when you do change the delivery time range in the prompt window, Send Later is now smart enough to adjust the other end of the range when it makes sense to do so. For example, if the start time is set to 11:00 AM and then you change the end time to 10:00 AM, the start time will adjust automatically to 10:00 AM, since it doesn&#8217;t make sense for the start time to be later than the end time.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the datepicker and timepicker that Send Later is now using don&#8217;t work when inserted into the composition window toolbar, so they are no longer among Send Later&#8217;s custom toolbar widgets.<\/p>\n<p>The Send Later progress bar which used to appear at the bottom of the main Thunderbird window every minute, and which was never particularly accurate or useful, is gone. In its place, when send Later is checking for scheduled messages to send its status at the bottom of the window changes to &#8220;CHECKING&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>SeaMonkey and Postbox are no longer supported. Support for them may return at some point, but it&#8217;s not clear when or if that will happen.<\/p>\n<p>There have been lots of updates to the translations, including a new Hungarian translation. Thanks very much to all of my translators!<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of translations, previously the add-on was displaying &#8220;Send Later&#8221; as the name of the add-on even for translations which had opted to translate the name into a foreign language. This has now been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, when you went to edit the preset buttons in the preferences, the label preference for each button showed &#8220;&#8221; instead of the actual label for the button. This was confusing and has been fixed, so now the actual label for the button is displayed in the preferences.<\/p>\n<p>A tooltip has been added for the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; composition window toolbar button.<\/p>\n<p>The library that Send Later uses for parsing dates and times, SugarJS, has been updated to a newer version which should be at least slightly better at parsing.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-7.0.9\"><\/a>Release 7.0.9 (September 5, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Translation updates.<\/p>\n<p>BUGFIX: Previously, the English version of Send Later was displaying the scheduled message count twice at the bottom of the main Thunderbird window, e.g., if there were two scheduled messages it would display &#8220;PEND 2 2&#8221; instead of &#8220;PEND 2&#8221;.

So, for example, if the start time is set to 11:00 AM and then you change the end time to 10:00 AM, the start time will change to 10:00 AM automatically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Translation updates<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add an incomplete Hungarian translation.<\/p>\n<p>Add the bare-bones of a Danish translation (you won&#8217;t actually see any translated strings in the UI yet).<\/p>\n<p>Thanks as always to my translators!

Please <a href=\"mailto:jik+sendlater3@kamens.us\">let me know<\/a> if you run into any problems that aren&#8217;t mentioned below!<\/p>\n<p>Here are the known, user-visible changes in this release:<\/p>\n<p>The datepicker and timepickers in the Send Later dialog are currently disabled, and the datepicker \/ timepicker combo that goes in the compose window toolbar doesn&#8217;t work. This is because there are currently problems with the datepicker and timepicker widgets, so I can&#8217;t get them to work in Send Later. This has two functional impacts until I am able to fix it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>You have to enter the send time by typing it rather than being able to click.<\/li>\n<li>You can&#8217;t set time-of-day restrictions on scheduled messages.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The preferences window (tab, actually) now has &#8220;Reset&#8221;, &#8220;Cancel&#8221;, and &#8220;OK&#8221; buttons, and any changes you make to preferences aren&#8217;t actually saved untli you close the window or click the &#8220;OK&#8221; button.<\/p>\n<p>At some point prior to Thunderbird 68 the functionality for validating preferences before saving them was lost. This has now been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>The progress bar, which was has not been particularly useful for a long time, is gone. Instead of a progress bar, Send Later now displays a status of &#8220;CHECKING&#8221; while it is doing its periodic check for scheduled messages. Note that this message has not yet been translated so at least for this release it will appear as &#8220;CHECKING&#8221; in all languages.<\/p>\n<p>References to addons.mozilla.org have been replaced with addons.thunderbird.net throughout.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.5.0\"><\/a>Release 6.5.0 (March 1, 2020)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Fix bug in putting previous scheduled send time in compose toolbar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the user adds the send time text box to the compose toolbar and then edits a previously scheduled message, the previous send time is supposed to show up in the text box automatically, but instead the word &#8220;long&#8221; was showing up because I forgot a couple of curly braces in a date formatting string. I&#8217;m amazed that this has been broken for almost six months and no one has mentioned it to me before now.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.4.8\"><\/a>Release 6.4.8 (February 3, 2020)<\/h3>\n<p>Compatibility changes for Thunderbird 45 through 52.

It modifies the format of dynamic scheduling function export files slightly to make them easier to read and edit in text editors outside of Thunderbird. This change was made to facilitate the creation of a library of shared scheduling functions.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.4.4\"><\/a>Release 6.4.4 (January 6, 2019)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 6.4.3:<\/p>\n<p>Make the dynamic function editor window resizable.<\/p>\n<p>Fix the &#8220;Import&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Export&#8230;&#8221; buttons in the dynamic function editor, which it turns out were broken by a change in Thunderbird 57.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.4.3\"><\/a>Release 6.4.3 (November 13, 2018)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 6.4.2:<\/p>\n<p>Some versions of Thunderbird being used in a locale that uses UTF-8 (i.e., non-ASCII) characters were garbling the display of dates in the send button in the prompt window. This has been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>The Turkish and Armenian translations have been updated, but are still incomplete.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.4.2\"><\/a>Release 6.4.2 (November 12, 2018)<\/h3>\n<p>Fix how the scheduled date of messages in the Drafts folder is displayed so that the formatting obeys the current locale. For example, in the United States, the date should be displayed in MM\/DD\/YYYY format, while in the United Kingdom it should be DD\/MM\/YYYY.<\/p>\n<p>Fix bug in date-picker for some older Thunderbird versions. The API in Thunderbird for formatting dates has been in a great deal of flux for the past several Thunderbird releases. Release 6.4.1 of Send Later was an attempt to make the date code in Send Later compatible up to Thunderbird 60.3.0. Unfortunately, although the changes did achieve compatibility with newer Thunderbird releases, they broke compatibility with older ones. This release attempts to address that.<\/p>\n<p>Add some improvements to the Bulgarian translation.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.4.1\"><\/a>Release 6.4.1 (November 8, 2018)<\/h3>\n<p>Fix two problems with the date-picker widgets, i.e., the user interface elements in the compose window toolbar and Send Later pop-up dialog which allow you to choose the date for which to schedule the message:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Send Later should now correctly obey the user&#8217;s locale settings when determining the order in which to put the year, month, and day in the date-picker.<\/li>\n<li>The date-picker will now (I hope) work correctly in some locales where previously it didn&#8217;t work at all.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The minimum compatible Thunderbird version for Send Later is now 32.

This has been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that versions of Send Later newer than 6.2.1 are incompatible with Thunderbird 24.* and older. Those versions of Thunderbird are nearly five years old and are no longer maintained, which means that they have numerous unpatched security holes on them. As such, users are strongly urged to upgrade to the current version of Thunderbird. If that is not possible for whatever reason, you may continue to use Send Later by downloading and installing <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/send-later-3\/versions\/6.2.1\">version 6.2.1<\/a>, but you will not get any new Send Later features or bug fixes.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.3.6\"><\/a>Release 6.3.6 (March 22, 2018)<\/h3>\n<p>This release contains only changes that no one should notice:<\/p>\n<p>Compatibility changes for recent versions of Thunderbird.<\/p>\n<p>Upgrade to the current version of SugarJS.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.3.5\"><\/a>Release 6.3.5 (February 24, 2018)<\/h3>\n<p>BUGFIX: If a user set the hidden extension `extensions.sendlater3.first_day_of_of_week` to change how calendars display in date-pickers in Send Later, then the dates weren&#8217;t lined up properly under the day headers in the calendars.

When Send Later inserts these headers, they are on a single line in the message header, and the code for removing them later previously assumed that they would <em>remain<\/em> on a single line. However, some IMAP servers wrap headers when messages are saved into an IMAP server. As a result, some headers were being wrapped, and then Send Later removed those headers incompletely at delivery time because it left behind the wrapped text. The code has now been fixed to remove the wrapped text as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUG FIX: Strip &#8220;Openpgp&#8221; header from scheduled messages during delivery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a constant arms race between Send Later and other Thunderbird functionality&#8230; Send Later needs to figure out what temporary, internal headers are saved by other Thunderbird functionality and remove those headers from scheduled drafts when sending them. The newest header I&#8217;ve discovered in this category is the &#8220;Openpgp&#8221; header, which Send Later now removes.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.3.3\"><\/a>Release 6.3.3 (December 26, 2017)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 6.3.2:<\/p>\n<p>Fix preferences button in add-ons manager in Thunderbird 59+.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.3.2\"><\/a>Release 6.3.2 (December 14, 2017)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes for compatibility with the newest Thunderbird and SeaMonkey versions.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.3.1\"><\/a>Release 6.3.1 (September 26, 2017)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 6.3:<\/p>\n<p>Update the Dutch, Galician, Japanese, Portuguese from Portugal, Brazilian Portuguese, and Turkish translations.

Therefore, I can&#8217;t continue to support Postbox in new Send Later releases until the maintainers of Postbox upgrade their JavaScript interpreter. In the meantime, Postbox users can continue to use <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/send-later-3\/versions\/6.2.1\">version 6.2.1 of Send Later<\/a>, the final release which is compatible with Postbox.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUGFIX: Embedded images corrupted when editing scheduled drafts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A recently introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=1389242\">Thunderbird bug<\/a> was causing embedded images to become corrupted when the user opened a previously scheduled draft with embedded images to edit it.

Previously, this only worked in Thunderbird.<\/p>\n<p><strong>COMPATIBILITY: Some old Thunderbird and SeaMonkey releases are no longer supported<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Several old, obsolete JavaScript constructs and interfaces used by Send Later are being desupported in impending Thunderbird and SeaMonkey releases. I&#8217;ve therefore had to update Send Later&#8217;s code to use newer, supported constructs and interfaces. These are not compatible with Thunderbird releases prior to 20 or SeaMonkey releases prior to 2.17, so those older releases can no longer be supported.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.2.1\"><\/a>Release 6.2.1 (June 29, 2017)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 6.2:<\/p>\n<p>Add a new preference controlling whether scheduled drafts are marked as read in the drafts folder or remain marked unread.

Previously, the message ID which Send Later used when sending a scheduled message was identical to the message ID that was used while the message was being stored in your Drafts folder. Furthermore, Send Later previously used that same message ID for all sent copies of recurring messages. Using the same message ID for drafts and recurring messages was incorrect both because message IDs of different copies of messages are supposed to be unique, and because some mail servers might get confused when a draft and a sent message have the same message ID.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, when a recurring message was sent, Send Later briefly failed to include it in the count of pending messages. Now, Send Later consistently counts recurring messages in the pending message count.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.1.3\"><\/a>Release 6.1.3 (May 24, 2017)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 6.1.2:<\/p>\n<p>New Russian translation.<\/p>\n<p>Minor updates to some other translations.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.1.2\"><\/a>Release 6.1.2 (March 1, 2017)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 6.1:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Guard against a corrupted Outbox causing messages to be resent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thunderbird\u2019s local folder storage format keeps deleted messages on disk, but invisible to the user, until their folder is compacted. Usually this causes no trouble, but occasionally Thunderbird corrupts a local folder and loses track of messages which messages were deleted, causing them to \u201cmagically\u201d appear in the folder again. In most cases, this causes no further harm than deleted messages being resurrected, an annoying nuisance but not a huge problem.<\/p>\n<p>However, when Send Later is being used, and when the folder this happens to is the user\u2019s Outbox folder, it can cause a big problem: messages that were previously sent with Send Later can be resurrected and resent. If it has been a long time since the Outbox was last compacted, a lot of messages can be resent. This is bad.<\/p>\n<p>Send Later now guards against this by by automatically compacting the Outbox folder whenever Thunderbird finishes sending its messages and it is visibly empty, i.e., the only messages remaining in it are invisible, deleted messages.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make locale-based first-day-of-week work in calendar pop-ups<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a bug in Thunderbird which was preventing the calendar pop-ups displayed by Send Later from starting the week on the correct day, in locales where that day isn\u2019t Sunday. See https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=516796. Fortunately, there\u2019s a workaround for this bug, which has now been implemented in Send Later. Therefore, if your computer starts weeks with the correct day elsewhere, it should now do so in the Send Later calendar pop-ups as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous minor changes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The command key for the \u201cClose\u201d button in the dynamic function editor is now Ctrl-W in every language, as it should be.<\/p>\n<p>A bunch of button access keys (i.e., the letters you an type with Alt to activate the buttons) have been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>Use the Unicode ellipsis character instead of three periods. Also, use Unicode quotes instead of ASCII double quotes.<\/p>\n<p>Be more consistent about the add-on name in translations, i.e., decide for each translation whether the add-on name is going to be \u201cSend Later\u201d in English or a translated version, and carry that decision throughout the entire translation.<\/p>\n<p>Translation updates.<\/p>\n<p>Update the URL of the user guide because it\u2019s got SSL (https) now.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.1\"><\/a>Release 6.1 (August 20, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 6.0.3:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enhancements to day\/time restrictions and scheduling functions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Previously, the day-of-week and time-of-day restrictions in the Send Later prompt window could only be used with recurring messages or scheduling functions. Now they can be used when specifying only a single send time explicitly as well. You can do some clever things when combining this with saving defaults in the prompt window. For example, if you always want messages to be sent within a particular time window, you could put &#8220;now&#8221; in the prompt window&#8217;s text box and specify the desired time window in the &#8220;Between&#8221; settings, then save those defaults, and from then on, whenever you bring up the prompt window and click the &#8220;Send at&#8221; button, it&#8217;ll either send the message immediately &#8212; if it&#8217;s within the correct time window &#8212; or move it to be within the time window.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, when you used a non-recurring dynamic scheduling function such as the &#8220;BusinessHours&#8221; function that is created by default when you open the dynamic function editor, the fact that the message was scheduled with a function is not saved, so if you go to edit the function later and then try to re-schedule it, rather than defaulting to using the same dynamic function again, it defaulted to the time that the message was previously scheduled to be sent. Now, the function name is saved, and if you edit and re-schedule the message the prompt window will be pre-configured to use it again.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, when you specify day-of-week or time-of-day restrictions when scheduling a message with either an explicit send time or a non-recurring dynamic function, the restrictions you specify will now be saved, so that if you edit and re-schedule the message, they will be set up in the prompt window automatically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other enhancements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you click the &#8220;Calculate&#8221; button in the prompt window, the text-box the date and time pickers are now updated with the results along with the text box.<\/p>\n<p>If you accidentally click &#8220;Save defaults&#8221; or &#8220;Clear defaults&#8221; in the prompt window, you can now click it again to undo the first click (prevously, once you clicked either of them, you then had to leave one or the other selected).<\/p>\n<p>In Postbox, the Send Later status message and progress bar in the main window has been moved to the system tray, which is deprecated in Postbox, to below the folder list.<\/p>\n<p>The Catalan, Dutch, and German translations have been updated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bug fixes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A bug which prevented a scheduled message with a day-of-week restriction from being sent unless it also had a time-of-day restriction has been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>Automatically displaying the release notes for new major or minor releases was broken in release 6.0 and is now fixed.<\/p>\n<p>The logic for displaying the release notes for new major or minor releases had a bug which was causing it to sometimes display them for patch releases as well. This has been fixed, and now the release notes will be displayed only for major, minor, and beta releases (the latter obviously only for users who are subscribed to the beta release channel).<\/p>\n<p>Send Later&#8217;s translations use parameterized substitutions in some translated strings, i.e., the string is used as a template into which values are substituted to customize it for the particular message being displayed. A few of the rarely used strings had missing or incorrect substitution patterns in them in some languages. In addition to fixing these, the build process for the add-on has been modified to prevent similar bugs from being introduced in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Non-functional changes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fix an undefined variable reference in some code that should never actually be executed since it indicates an internal error in the add-on.<\/p>\n<p>Fix some incorrect invocations of Array.splice which were treating the second argument as the end index of the splice, rather than as the number of elemented to replace in the array. These incorrect invocations weren&#8217;t actually having a functional impact because of the way the code was otherwise constructed, but they could at some point in the future and they were clearly wrong, so they&#8217;ve been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>The code that was supposed to display an error pop-up when there was an unexpected error invoking a dynamic scheduling function was broken, and that code would itself cause an uncaught error and cause the add-on to malfunction. Users are unlikely to have run into this issue, but in any case it has been fixed.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.0.3\"><\/a>Release 6.0.3 (August 6, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 6.0.2:<\/p>\n<p>BUG: Scheduling messages with monthly recurrence was broken and has been fixed.<\/p>\n<p>BUG: Fix incompatibility with Thunderbird versions before 17.<\/p>\n<p>BUG: Fix incompatibility with Seamonkey versions newer than 2.41a1.<\/p>\n<p>BUG: Fix the pop-up menu in the main Thunderbird window so it only pops up when you click on the Thunderbird part of the status bar, rather than when you click anywhere in the status bar.<\/p>\n<p>ENHANCEMENT: When there are no dynamic scheduling functions defined, i.e., before the first time the user has opened the dynamic function editor, desensitize the dynamic function selector in the Send Later prompt window, since there are no dynamic functions to select.<\/p>\n<p>ENHANCEMENT: Fix the height of the dynamic function pop-up menu in theSend Later prompt window so that it is correctly full height, rather than being very short until the user selects a function.<\/p>\n<p>I18N: Translation updates.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-6.0.2\"><\/a>Release 6.0.2 (July 7, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>This release of Send Later includes several exciting new features!<\/p>\n<h4>Dynamic scheduling function support<\/h4>\n<p>Send Later 6.0 includes a totally new dynamic scheduling function editor and makes <a href=\"#dynamic\">dynamic scheduling functions<\/a> fully accessible through the Send Later dialog and shortcut buttons. This means that you can easily write JavaScript function to implement arbitrarily complex message scheduling logic (for example, the most common request I get: &#8220;Can I click a button to make the message send during business hours, rather than in the middle of the night when I&#8217;m composing it?&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Read more in the <a href=\"#dynamic\">updated user guide<\/a> or click on \u201cSend Later\u201d in your status bar and select \u201cDynamic function editor\u201d to open the editor and read the built-in documentation.<\/p>\n<p>While it was possible to use dynamic scheduling functions in previous Send Later releases, it required significant &#8220;back-end&#8221; configuration and a reliance on other add-ons; this is no longer the case.<\/p>\n<h4>Save default settings in the Send Later dialog<\/h4>\n<p>You can now save default settings in the Send Later dialog when scheduling a message, and subsequent invocations of the dialog (until you clear the defaults) will start with the settings you saved.<\/p>\n<h4>Pop-up menu on main Thunderbird window<\/h4>\n<p>There is now a pop-up menu accessible by clicking on \u201cSend Later\u201d in the status bar, giving you easy access to Send Later\u2019s preferences, dynamic function editor, user guide, release notes, emailing the author, and making a donation.<\/p>\n<h4>SpamFighter compatibility<\/h4>\n<p>Send Later is now compatible with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spamfighter.com\/\">SpamFighter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Improved Send Later icons<\/h4>\n<p>The Send Later icons have been improved a bit.<\/p>\n<h4>Internationalization<\/h4>\n<p>This release includes a new Catalan translation, and an incomplete Greek translation.<\/p>\n<p>This release also includes various other translation updates. Thanks, as always, to my translators, in particular my new Polish translator, Piotr Przybylski (Gabry$).<\/p>\n<h4>Bug fixes<\/h4>\n<p>A bug in the interpretation of day-of-week restrictions, which could sometimes cause recurring messages subject to such restrictions to be sent on the wrong day, has been fixed.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-5.2.1\"><\/a>Release 5.2.1 (June 16, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Summary: If you need the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button in the Send Later dialog, then you need to launch the dialog using Ctrl-Shift-Enter, the &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221; menu command, or the button provided by the &#8220;Send Later Button&#8221; add-on. If, on the other hand, you need the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button in the Send Later dialog, then you need to have the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference enabled, and you need to launch the dialog using the &#8220;Send&#8221; button, Ctrl-Enter, or the &#8220;File | Send Now&#8221; menu command. Please read on for the details surrounding this change.<\/p>\n<p>There has been a lot of flip-flopping in this area of the add-on&#8217;s functionality, caused in part by the fact that there are so many moving parts that I&#8217;ve had trouble keeping them all straight in my mind, so I&#8217;m going to try to explain clearly here exactly what&#8217;s going on and why I&#8217;m reverting this change, so that all the necessary information is known going forward.<\/p>\n<p>There are two buttons in the Send Later prompt window: &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; and &#8220;Send Now&#8221;. These two buttons bypass the Send Later message scheduling mechanism in two different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; puts the message being edited directly into the Thunderbird Outbox folder, such that it will be delivered the next time the user (or Send Later, or BlunderDelay) executes the &#8220;File | Send Unsent Messages&#8221; menu command.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Send Now&#8221; delivers the message to its intended recipients immediately rather than scheduling the message for later delivery with Send Later.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, the only way that both of these buttons can always work is if Send Later &#8220;cheats&#8221; and does things it&#8217;s not supposed to during the message scheduling and delivery process. This cheating causes all sorts of other issues, such as incompatibilities with other add-ons, Thunderbird popping up warnings and spell-checking windows multiple times, etc., so it&#8217;s a rather bad idea, and we don&#8217;t want Send Later to be doing that.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in a recent release of Send Later, the cheating was removed, and that meant it was no longer possible for both of these buttons to work properly every time the Send Later dialog is displayed. In particular:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>If the Send Later dialog is opened with Thunderbird&#8217;s own Send Later command, i.e., typing Ctrl-Shift Enter, selecting the &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221; menu command, or using the button provided by the &#8220;Send Later Button&#8221; add-on, then it is possible to make the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button work properly in the dialog, but it is <em>not<\/em> possible to make the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; button work.<\/li>\n<li>Conversely, if the user has the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference enabled, such that Thunderbird&#8217;s own &#8220;Send Now&#8221; command (i.e., typing Ctrl-Enter, selecting the &#8220;File | Send Now&#8221; menu command, or clicking the &#8220;Send&#8221; button) is used to launch the Send Later dialog, then in that particular instance of the dialog, it is possible to make the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button work properly, but it is <em>not<\/em> possible to make the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Because the removal of the cheating code meant it was no longer possible to make both of these buttons work every time the dialog was opened, Send Later&#8217;s code was modified to display only the button that will actually work properly.<\/p>\n<p>After the release with this change was shipped, I started to get feedback from users complaining &#8212; in some cases rather vociferously &#8212; about this change. Some people complained about the disappearance of the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button, others complained about the missing &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, I should have explained as above why it was no longer possible for both of these buttons to be present, and further explained that if the user needs the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button, the dialog needs to be launched with the &#8220;Send&#8221; button or Ctrl-Enter or &#8220;File | Send Now&#8221;, whereas if the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button is needed, the dialog needs to be launched with the &#8220;Send Later&#8221; button or Ctrl-Shift-Enter or &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, with all of the complaints coming in, I got confused, and I somehow convinced myself that the buttons were removed not because it was not possible to make them work all the time without cheating, but rather because users were sometimes getting confused and clicking one of these buttons when it wasn&#8217;t actually needed. Actually, reducing the likelihood of user confusion wasn&#8217;t the reason why the buttons were removed; it was merely a beneficial side-effect.<\/p>\n<p>I need to apologize to those users whom I told that the buttons were removed to reduce user confusion. I was wrong. I&#8217;m sorry for giving you incorrect information.<\/p>\n<p>I also need to apologize to everyone for the &#8220;churn&#8221; of putting out release 5.2 which added a preference which puts both buttons back, when in fact with that preference enabled, <em>one of the buttons in the dialog is always going to function incorrectly<\/em>. So rather than solving the problem I hoped to solve in release 5.2, I introduced a new problem, an actual bug, which could cause messages to be put into the user&#8217;s Outbox when the user intended to send them, or sent directly when the user intended to put them in the Outbox. I&#8217;m sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Release 5.2, which introduced potentially incorrect behavior as described above, has been removed from addons.mozilla.org and is no longer available for downloads or automatic upgrades.<\/p>\n<p>This new release undoes the change introduced in release 5.2. There is no longer a preference to cause both of the buttons to be displayed all the time, because it is simply not possible to make that work properly without Send Later interacting with Thunderbird in a way that it&#8217;s not supposed to and that isn&#8217;t sustainable or maintainable.<\/p>\n<p>Just to reiterate, if you need the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button in the Send Later dialog, then you need to launch the dialog using Ctrl-Shift-Enter, the &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221; menu command, or the button provided by the &#8220;Send Later Button&#8221; add-on. If, on the other hand, you need the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button in the Send Later dialog, then you need to have the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference enabled, and you need to launch the dialog using the &#8220;Send&#8221; button, Ctrl-Enter, or the &#8220;File | Send Now&#8221; menu command.<\/p>\n<p>If you <em>don&#8217;t<\/em> have the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference enabled, and you launch the Send Later dialog the normal way (with Ctrl-Shift-Enter, &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221;, or the &#8220;Send Later Button&#8221; button), and then you decide that actually you want to send the message right away, all you need to do is close the Send Later dialog or click the Cancel button and then send the message normally.<\/p>\n<p>I am sorry to those of you whose workflows are disrupted by this change. If you are unable to figure out a new workflow which accommodates this change, <em>please<\/em> <a href=\"mailto:jik@kamens.us\">email me<\/a> and describe to me in detail how you&#8217;re using the add-on and how this change is impacting you, and I will try to help you find a way to make it work.<\/p>\n<p>Additional information about this release.<\/p>\n<p>This release includes a few translation updates. Thanks, as always, to my translators!<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-5.2\"><\/a>Release 5.2 (June 15, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Release 5.2 has been withdrawn from addons.mozilla.org and is no longer available there, due to a bug described above in the release notes for 5.2.1.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Changes since release 5.1:<\/p>\n<p>This release adds a preference which, if enabled, causes both the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; and &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; buttons to always be displayed in the Send Later dialog, rather than displaying one or the other based on how the dialog was opened.<\/p>\n<p>The only-display-one-or-the-other functionality was added in Send Later release 5.1 in an effort to minimize the incidents of people using these buttons incorrectly. However, since the 5.1 release, I&#8217;ve heard from a number of people whose workflows depended on both buttons being present all the time. I had not anticipated these workflows when making the change. Since they are reasonable workflows, I am adding this preference to enable them.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-5.1\"><\/a>Release 5.1 (June 13, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 5.0.1:<\/p>\n<p>Send Later is now fully compatible with Enigmail! Many thanks to Patrick Brunschwig from the Enigmail development team for working with me to make this possible.<\/p>\n<p>Thunderbird now pops up the spell-check-before-send window (if it is enabled) and checks messages for empty Subject lines when they are scheduled using buttons or input fields on the compose window toolbar. Previously, neither spell-checking nor the empty-subject check would happen in this context (i.e., this was a bug, and it is now fixed).<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button in the Send Later dialog now pops up a dialog when it is used, to ensure that users don&#8217;t click it when they actually meant to click the scheduled send button. There is a checkbox in this dialog to allow it to be suppressed in the future.<\/p>\n<p>In a further effort to reduce confusion about the &#8220;Put In Outbox&#8221; and &#8220;Send Now&#8221; buttons in the Send Later dialog, the &#8220;Put In Outbox&#8221; button is now only visible when the dialog is popped up using &#8220;File | Send Later&#8221; or Ctrl-Shift-Enter, and the &#8220;Send Now&#8221; button is now only visible when the &#8220;&#8216;Send&#8217; Does &#8216;Send Later'&#8221; preference is enabled and the dialog is popped up using &#8220;File | Send Now&#8221; or Ctrl-Enter.<\/p>\n<p>This release includes many translation updates. Thanks, as always, to my wonderful team of translators!<\/p>\n<p>This release increases compatibility settings for newer Thunderbird and Seamonkey releases.<\/p>\n<p>As a side benefit of the other work enumerated above, a good chunk of the add-on&#8217;s code has been cleaned up and refactored.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-5.0.1\"><\/a>Release 5.0.1 (June 6, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Fixed a couple of bugs in the time-of-day restriction functionality introduced in release 5.0.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-5.0\"><\/a>Release 5.0 (May 31, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 4.4.5:<\/p>\n<p>There are some exciting changes in this release of Send Later!<\/p>\n<p>New features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Messages can now be scheduled to send on a minutely basis, i.e., every minute, or every 2 minutes, or every 3 minutes, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Delivery of recurring messages can now be restricted by time of day and day of week. This restriction is enforced on the message&#8217;s initial scheduled delivery time and in each subsequently scheduled recurring delivery. Furthermore, there is a preference you can enable to enforce it on late message delivery as well. In other words, if Thunderbird isn&#8217;t running when at the scheduled delivery time, and when you launch Thunderbird the current time conflicts with the delivery restrictions, then by default the message will be delivered despite the conflict, but if you enable the preference, then delivery will be delayed until the delivery restrictions are satisfied.<\/li>\n<li>There is a new preference you can enable to prevent Send Later from delivering messages late, e.g., because Thunderbird wasn&#8217;t running at the scheduled delivery time. When this preference is enabled, Send Later will pop up a warning about the late message instead of delivering it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bug fixes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The shortcut buttons in the compose window toolbar are now disabled when a previously scheduled message with recurrence is edited. In this context, the user should open the Send Later dialog to reschedule the message, rather than using shortcut buttons.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;week of the month&#8221; checkbox (e.g., &#8220;1st Saturday of the month&#8221;, &#8220;3rd Tuesday of the month&#8221;) in the scheduling dialog is now disabled correctly when the user clears the scheduled send time or switches to a recurrence frequency other than monthly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.4.5\"><\/a>Release 4.4.5 (April 11, 2016)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 4.4.4:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Disable scheduling messages when Enigmail is active<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, limitations in the Thunderbird add-on framework make it somewhere between difficult and impossible to make scheduled messages with Send Later work safely and properly when the Enigmail add-on is installed and enabled.<\/p>\n<p>However, Send Mail can successfully deliver previously scheduled messages even when Enigmail is active.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, Send Later now displays an alert pop-up and disables the scheduling of messages when Enigmail is enabled. If\/when Enigmail is disabled or uninstalled and Thunderbird is restarted, Send Later automatically re-enables itself.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.4.4\"><\/a>Release 4.4.4 (August 26, 2015)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since release 4.4.3:<\/p>\n<p><b>Bug: Fix Send Later column after using quick filter<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Previously, if you used the quick filter bar to search messages in the Drafts folder, then the Send Later column would stop working.

It&#8217;s better now, but it&#8217;s incompatible with the old mechanism. See <a href=\"#toolbar\">above<\/a> for details.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bug fix: Fix the Dutch, Finnish and Swedish translations to reflect the fact that the check interval preference is now minutes rather than milliseconds. I&#8217;m not sure how updating these particular translations got overlooked when this functionality change was made. Sorry! Enhancement: When Thunderbird encounters an error sending unsent messages (i.e., delivering messages from the Outbox after Send Later has put them there), log the error in the error console, to assist in debugging what is causing it (which, to be clear, is a Thunderbird problem, not a Send Later problem). Enhancement: Update the Swedish translation. Enhancement: Update the URL of the user guide in error messages (the old URL works but is deprecated). Also, add the user guide URL to a Finnish error message that was missing it. Non-functional: In the source code for the add-on, comment out a function that is only used during testing so that the add-on validator on addons.mozilla.org doesn&#8217;t complain about it.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.1.3\"><\/a>Release 4.1.3 (October 19, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 4.1.2: Bug fix: A bug was introduced in version 4.1.2 which caused recurring messages to fail to be rescheduled after being sent. Enhancement: Add access keys for the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button in the prompt window. You can now type Alt-O (or the equivalent in other languages) to activate the button. Bug fix: Dynamic recurrence functions should be able to return Date objects, not just numbers of minutes.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.1.2\"><\/a>Release 4.1.2 (October 13, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>NOTE: If you had Send Later in your compose window toolbar prior to this release, you may need to add it back.<\/strong> The toolbar customization mechanism was recently changed. It&#8217;s better now, but it&#8217;s incompatible with the old mechanism. See <a href=\"#toolbar\">above<\/a> for details. Changes since release 4.0.6: Fix bug introduced in version 4.0.7: Don&#8217;t send scheduled messages twice! Bug fix: The scheduled send time was not being calculated properly when it was entered using the date and time pickers, and the keyboard rather than the mouse was used to change their values. Enhancement: Dynamic shortcuts can now implement recurrence! See <a href=\"#dynamic-recurrence\">above<\/a>. Enhancement: Make explanatory text appear inside the text box in the &#8220;Customize Toolbar&#8221; window so that it&#8217;s clearer that the text box is for Send Later. Bug fix: In rare cases Send Later was failing to notice scheduled drafts. Bug fix: Various date parsing improvements from Andrew Plummer, the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/sugarjs.com\/\">SugarJS<\/a>, the date parsing library used by Send Later. Bug fix: Don&#8217;t cause &#8220;Error Copying Message to Drafts Folder&#8221; when hitting Ctrl-Enter in the text box in the pop-up window, or when clicking on the shortcut buttons in the toolbar. Bug fix: Do not allow Enter or Ctrl-Enter to work when valid time has not been entered. Enhancement: Dynamic shortcut buttons can now return a Date object rather than the number of minutes into the future. Bug fix (internal, no change in functionality): Use closures instead of script fragments for event listeners, as suggested by AMO editors.

The add-on was previously named &#8220;Send Later 3&#8221; because there was an old &#8220;Send Later&#8221; add-on with similar functionality for old Thunderbird versions, but that add-on has not been maintained for years and is no longer even available on addons.mozilla.org, so it is time to take its place. Enhancement: Add back the ability to choose the date and time using the mouse using date and time pickers, instead of or in addition to use free-form text input. Enhancement: Each of the add-on&#8217;s compose window toolbar items can now be added and positioned separately, giving the user complete control over the items appearing in the toolbar. Furthermore, the user can choose whether to put free-form text input, date\/time pickers, or both in the toolbar. Enhancement: Since the shortcut buttons are now added or removed by customizing the compose window toolbar directly, there are no longer checkboxes in the add-on&#8217;s preferences controlling whether the buttons appear in the toolbar. Enhancement: Change the &#8220;SENDLATER3&#8221; status tag at the bottom of the main Thunderbird window to match the add-on&#8217;s name in every language. Enhancement: Add a Chinese description to the install manifest, so that the description that shows up in Tools | Add-ons for Chinese users will be in their native language. Bug fix: The Send Later button in the pop-up prompt window is now activated, as it should be, when the window first comes up when re-scheduling a previously scheduled draft. Bug fix: Prepopulating the scheduled send time when editing a previously scheduled message was not working in some circumstances. Bug fix: The schedule button in the toolbar was not always being updated properly with the scheduled send time. Enhancement: Improvements to Dutch date parsing. Bug fix: If user has OS configured with custom date format, then sometimes the prepopulated scheduled send time inserted when editing a previously scheduled message is not understood by Send Later 3! Bug fix: Add missing space after typo in error message.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.0.5\"><\/a>Release 4.0.5 (September 25, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>Release 4.0.5 was replaced by release 4.0.6.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.0.4\"><\/a>Release 4.0.4 (September 19, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>Enhancement: Add Dutch date parsing. Bug fix: Some users have been seeing &#8220;Drafts folder may be corrupt&#8221; errors repeatedly, even after repairing all of their Drafts folders. Bug fix: In recent (not yet released to the general public) versions of Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, displaying the release notes after updating the add-on was not working properly. Bug fix: When editing a previously scheduled recurring message, the text box and button in the toolbar are supposed to be disabled because recurring messages can only be scheduled from the pop-up dialog. However, they were not being disabled as they should have been. This is now fixed. Bug fix: In recent (probably not yet released to the general public) versions of Thuderbird and SeaMonkey, when the user edited a previously scheduled draft and then immediately tried to close the message compose window without actually making any changes to the draft, Thunderbird was asking the user whether to save the draft, even though it was unmodified and didn&#8217;t need saving.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-4.0.3\"><\/a>Release 4.0.3 (September 8, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>I am <strong>very excited<\/strong> to announce release 4.0.3 of Send Later 3!

Thanks! You can also be very helpful with minimal effort by beta-testing new versions of the add-on. I do my best to test new versions thoroughly, but I can miss things, so the more people I have testing new versions with me, the more likely it is that they will work for everyone. I fix problems discovered by beta testers very quickly, and if you do encounter a problem, you can always revert to the previous non-beta version until I am able to fix it. So please, help make Send Later 3 better for everyone by signing up as a beta tester! See the user guide for more information if you&#8217;re interested. Thank you. Don&#8217;t forget to join <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/send-later-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the mailing list<\/a>! Before describing the changes in this release, I want to give a huge shout-out to Andrew Plummer, the maintainer of the <a href=\"http:\/\/sugarjs.com\/\">SugarJS library<\/a> upon which much of the functionality in the new release depends. I also want to give a huge round of applause to my translators who have helped to make this release great. They are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Dtrieb from BabelZilla (de)<\/li>\n<li>Erwin D. Glockner (de)<\/li>\n<li>urko from BabelZilla (es-ES)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/114276880405600229762\">Samtron-Translations<\/a> (fi-FI)<\/li>\n<li>Bigpapa from BabelZilla (fr)<\/li>\n<li>Cesare from BabelZilla (it-IT)<\/li>\n<li>Amigomr from BabelZilla (ja-JP)<\/li>\n<li>markh from BabelZilla (nl)<\/li>\n<li>Maciej Kobuszewski (pl)<\/li>\n<li>Mikael Hiort af Orn\u00e4s (sv-SE)<\/li>\n<li>Wang.H.K from BabelZilla (zh-CN)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Free-form date\/time entry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The date and time for scheduling a message are no longer entered using clunky drop-downs. Instead, you just type in the date and time you want, and Send Later 3 parses what you typed and figures out what you meant. Date parsing is currently supported in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese (<a href=\"mailto:jik+sendlater3@kamens.us\">contact me<\/a> about adding support for additional languages). The add-on first attempts to parse dates using the language indicated by your locale, and if that fails, it falls back on English. Date parsing understands all sorts of interesting syntaxes in addition to conventional date\/time entry. For example, &#8220;the day after tomorrow&#8221;, &#8220;next Thursday at 15:00&#8221;, &#8220;the beginning of next week&#8221;, etc. Date parsing in Send Later 3 is provided by the most excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/sugarjs.com\/\">SugarJS library<\/a>, created and maintained by Andrew Plummer. Because such interesting date syntaxes can be ambiguous, Send Later 3 tells you what it thinks you meant by parsing your text in real-time and showing in the send button when the message will be sent. This new functionality also makes it easier to schedule multiple messages at the same time, something which has been frequently requested. Rather than being forced to painstakingly selected the same values in the drop-downs over and over, you can simply copy the desired date\/time into your clipboard and paste it into the date\/time entry field of each message. Add the field to your toolbar to make it even faster!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced recurring messages<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When scheduling a recurring message, you can now indicate a count in addition to a unit. In other words, whereas before you could specify only daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, now you can specify every 3 days, every 5 weeks, etc. Furthermore, you can schedule monthly messages on the same week and day of every month, e.g., &#8220;the third Tuesday of the month.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>SeaMonkey support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Send Later 3 now supports SeaMonkey!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Support for the Mail Merge add-on<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Starting with its version 3.4.0, the <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.thunderbird.net\/thunderbird\/addon\/mail-merge\/\">Mail Merge add-on<\/a> supports Send Later 3! Instructions for using Mail Merge with Send Later 3 can be found <a href=\"#mailmerge\">here<\/a>. (Note: Just to be clear, support for Send Later 3 in Mail Merge required changes to Mail Merge, not changes in Send Later 3. I&#8217;m not trying to take credit for the most excellent work of the author of the Mail merge add-on; I&#8217;m just letting people know that you can now use Mail Merge with Send Later 3.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other changes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the major enhancements described above, there are also a number of other changes in this release:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>There is a bug in Thunderbird 15 that breaks Send Later 3. This release includes a workaround for the bug.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;Send Later&#8221; column now displays properly in the unified Drafts folder.<\/li>\n<li>The color changes to the Send Later 3 pop-up window, which a number of people described as &#8220;garish&#8221; and did not care for, have been removed. These are no longer necessary now that the UI has been simplified and made clearer in other ways.<\/li>\n<li>The preference for controlling how often to check for messages whose scheduled send time has arrived has been changed from milliseconds to minutes, which makes a heck of a lot more sense.<\/li>\n<li>The pop-up window that requests donations for Send Later 3 has been changed so that it no longer has the potential to cause Thunderbird to hang on some platforms. This hang is due to a Thunderbird bug, not a bug in Send Later 3, but since the Thunderbird bug has not yet been fixed, it is important to work around it in the add-on.<\/li>\n<li>A bug which was causing recurring messages to be marked unread in the Drafts folder has been fixed.<\/li>\n<li>A workaround has been introduced in the code which should reduce the frequency of Send Later 3 complaining about a corrupt Drafts folder, specially when using POP3 or local folders.<\/li>\n<li>Send Later 3 now replaces the message ID in outgoing messages so that it does not inadvertently send multiple, different messages with the same message ID (relevant for both recurring messages and messages scheduled from templates).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-3.3.10\"><\/a>Release 3.3.10 (May 28, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>There are no functional changes in this release. See below for functional changes in previous releases. The only purpose of this particular release is to get the word out about this: <strong><em>THIS IS THE LAST VERSION OF THE ADD-ON WHICH WILL SUPPORT THUNDERBIRD 7 AND OLDER AND POSTBOX 2.<\/em><\/strong> The next version to be released after this one will include significant new functionality which cannot be implemented within Thunderbird 2 or Postbox 2. Users who do not wish to upgrade to a newer version of Thunderbird or Postbox may continue to use this version as-is, but there will be no further bug-fix or feature releases compatible with Thunderbird 2 or Postbox 2.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-3.3.9\"><\/a>Release 3.3.9 (May 25, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 3.3.8:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Fix sorting of Drafts folders by the Send later column.<\/li>\n<li>Another attempt to fix display of drop-down menus in compose toolbar on Thunderbird 2 on non-Linux platforms.

This is an attempt to fix the most common usage error people experience with this add-on, which is clicking this button when they should be clicking &#8220;Send Later at time(s) specified above&#8221;. Thank you very much to the Send Later 3 translators who assisted with this change!<\/li>\n<li>Change the font sizes and colors in the Send Later 3 dialog to make the primary functionality group clearer and attract the eye better, primarily to help people avoid clicking the &#8220;Put in Outbox&#8221; button when they should be clicking &#8220;Send Later at time(s) specified above&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Fix the display of the drop-down menus in the compose toolbar on Thunderbird 2 on platforms other than Linux.<\/li>\n<li>Add a missing tooltip for the Send Later button in the compose toolbar on Thunderbird 2.<\/li>\n<li>When displaying the release notes, scroll directly to the release notes for the version of the add-on that the user has installed.<\/li>\n<li>When asking the user to make a donation, make the request before sending the message rather than afterward, because otherwise on some platforms, e.g., Mac OS X, the donation request window disappears when the compose window is dismissed.<\/li>\n<li>New Simplified Chinese translation from yfdyh000 at BabelZilla.<\/li>\n<li>The French and Dutch translations have been updated slightly as well as moved to a different location within the innards of the add-on. If you use one of these translations, you might notice that some of the strings have changed, but otherwise they should continue to work just fine. <em>If they don&#8217;t,<\/em> please let me know.Compatible up to Thunderbird 15.0a1.<\/li>\n<li>(non-functional change) Remove unnecessary, empty translation string &#8220;separator.label&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>(non-functional change) Hard-code emacs coding-system into ambiguous files to avoid inadvertently saving them with the wrong coding system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-3.3.7\"><\/a>Release 3.3.7 (March 27, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>Changes since 3.3.5:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>In the error pop-up that appears when there is a corrupt Drafts folder that the add-on is unable to read, display a link to the section of the user guide which explains in detail what to do about this problem.<\/li>\n<li>Restructure how the add-on&#8217;s code is loaded to fix negative interactions with other add-ons. Specifically, this add-on was previously preventing the icons for the Enigmail and Dictionary Switcher add-ons from appearing at the bottom of message compose windows.<\/li>\n<li>Fix a bug introduced in version 3.3.6 when I updated the internal identifiers used in various components of the add-on as requested by the addons.mozilla.org editors. This bug was causing the scheduling pop-up to sometimes fail to schedule messages properly, as well as causing the scheduled send time to sometimes fail to display for scheduled messages.<\/li>\n<li>Fix a couple of coding errors introduced in 3.3.6 when the add-on&#8217;s code was restructured to fix negative interactions with other add-ons. These coding errors don&#8217;t affect recent versions of Thunderbird but do affect Thunderbird 2 and perhaps some intervening versions as well.<\/li>\n<li>Add a new hidden preference, extensions.sendlater3.send_while_offline. This preference is currently set to true by default. It can be changed using the advanced configuration editor.When this preference is true and the scheduled delivery time of a message arrives while Thunderbird is in offline mode, the message is moved into the Outbox and timestamped as of that time. When it is eventually delivered after you go online, the Date in the sent message will therefore correspond to its scheduled send time. As already noted, this is the default behavior and consistent with previous versions of the add-on.On the other hand, when this preference is false, messages whose scheduled delivery times have passed will not be moved into Outbox and timestamped until you go back online, which means the Date in the sent message will be when you went back online, not when the message was scheduled to be sent.I am interested in hearing from users which of these two behaviors you think is more correct, so that I can determine which should be the default and whether the setting should be visible in the preferences dialog. Please email me (jik+sendlater3@kamens.us) and let me know what you think.<\/li>\n<li>Add a Finnish translation. Than you to Samtron-Translations!<\/li>\n<li>Add the Japanese translation to the install manifest so the add-on&#8217;s description is displayed in Japanese (for Japanese users) in the add-on manager.<\/li>\n<li>Fix broken donation links. Addons.mozilla.org&#8217;s layout changed, and the old links stopped working.<\/li>\n<li>Compatible up to Thunderbird 14.0a1.<\/li>\n<li>Add some debugging code to help me figure out why one user is seeing the scheduling pop-up when he clicks the &#8220;Send&#8221; button when he shouldn&#8217;t be.<\/li>\n<li>(non-functional change) Remove the inclusion of a JavaScript script that the add-on wasn&#8217;t actually using, to prevent the unnecessary creation of extra global symbols. Change requested by the addons.mozilla.org editors.<\/li>\n<li>(non-functional change) Change the identifiers used within the code for various components of the add-on, to reduce the likelihood of namespace conflicts with other add-ons. Change requested by the addons.mozilla.org editors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Release 3.3.6 (March 20, 2012)<\/h3>\n<p>Version 3.3.6 was removed after release because of a serious bug in it.
