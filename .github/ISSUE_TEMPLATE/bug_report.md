**Prerequisites**

Please ensure that the following prerequisites are complete before filing a bug report. Check off each one to confirm:

- [ ] I am reporting a problem, not asking a question (for questions, go to [Discussions](https://github.com/Extended-Thunder/send-later/discussions).
- [ ] I have consulted the [user guide](https://extended-thunder.github.io/send-later/).
- [ ] I have confirmed that I'm running the current version and the problem persists there (note the version number in fine print next to the add-on name [on addons.thunderbird.net](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/send-later-3/) and compare it to the version number listed in the add-on details opened from the Add-ons page in Thunderbird; if you've got an old version, click the gear icon and select "Check for Updates").
- [ ] If I'm having an issue with date-parsing confusion, I've read the [section about that in the user guide](https://extended-thunder.github.io/send-later/#date-format-confusion-in-the-scheduler-pop-up) and I still think this is something different.
- [ ] If I'm having an issue with messages not being delivered, I've followed the [troubleshooting steps in the user guide](https://extended-thunder.github.io/send-later/#messages-dont-send-or-send-multiple-times) and it hasn't helped.
