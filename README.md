## Formatting with jekyll locally

Based on [this page][ghjekylllocal].

>     bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
>     bundle install
>     bundle exec jekyll serve
    
Note that for local formatting to work properly, you need to have a YAML header at the top of each file. See the headers at the top of existing files for examples.
