Pop-up when user tries to exit from Thunderbird, warning about
scheduled messages.

Allow drafts to be saved in a subfolder of a drafts folder, and check
subfolders for scheduled messages.

Share common code between toolbar and popup.

Bug: You shouldn't be allowed to schedule a message with no recopients
for future sending.

Send Later 3 should replicate Thunderbird behavior (after confirming
that in fact TB behaves this way) of adding "To:
undisclosed-recipients:;" to messages that are only being BCC'd.

Scheduling entry improvements:

* Add buttons on pop-up to copy current date/time setting to clipboard
  and fetch setting from current clipboard contents, to make it easy
  to schedule multiple messages to be sent at the same time.

* Calendar control pop-up for selecting scheduled date?

* Look into whether it might be possible to use a slider to send the
  scheduled send time instead of drop-downs. (idea from Daniel N. Lang
  [daniel@sonnefueralle.de]).

* Prompt for confirmation if the user tries to "schedule" a message
  but the time specified is now or in the past.

Need to figure out why Enigmail is bypassed when Send Later 3 is
used. UPDATE: It actually appears that in at least in some cases it is
working, but there's another problem -- the timestamp on the digital
signature is when the message was scheduled, not when it gets sent.

Enable the standard "Send Later" button, which is currently only
enabled when working offline.

Fix Send Later 3 to work when Thunderbird is in offline mode.

Investigate why DispMUA 1.6.5 doesn't work in TB2 when Send Later 3 is
installed.

If user has not yet entered master password in current Thunderbird
setting when message is scheduled to be sent, user gets prompted for
it, and if he's not there, the mail won't get sent. Need to look into
prompting for master password if needed when message is
scheduled. Other issue: can't save the password, so what if user
schedules message and then exits Thunderbird and restarts it later
without entering master password? Maybe need to have the backgrounding
process notice that master password is needed and prompt for it
whenever there are scheduled messages.

Add section to user guide about how to use Send Later 3 as
BlunderDelay. Even better, make it really easy to use Send Later 3
like BlunderDelay by adding a preference to override the Send button
and Ctrl-Return to automatically delay messages by a fixed amount of
time. Also -- maybe add a menu command to send all scheduled messages
now, and an optional prompt for whether to send scheduled messages
when Thunderbird is closed.

Use compose-send-message event rather than hijacking the send later
command, to play nicely with other add-ons that do stuff during
message send (e.g., UseBccInstead).

Make the add-on compatible with Tag Toolbar, in particular with
tagging replies / forwards with the same tags as their prior messages.

Bug: If you search in your drafts folder, then the "Send Later" column
in the search results isn't populated for matching drafts that are
scheduled to be sent later. It remains unpopulated when you cancel the
search, until you leave and return to the folder. Need to investigate
this!

Make format of Send Later date column configurable, a la
mail.ui.display.dateformat.

If Thunderbird is prompting for email format to use (html or text) for
a particular message, then it prompts twice, once before the Send
Later dialog pops up and once after you click the send button.

Transient notifications when Send Later 3 delivers messages.

Compatibility with "tag toolbar" and "copy send to current":

  Would it be possible to make sendlater "tags" aware? I also
  intensively use the "tag toolbar" and a typical workflow for me is
  to tag an outgoing mail and "copy send to current" copies a copy of
  the sent mail to a special folder.

  If i send the mail immediately the sent mail is copied to the
  special folder and the tags are preserved. If i send the mail using
  "sendlater" the mail gets copied to the special folder too but the
  tags are not preserved.

Shortcut labels should be dynamically generated.

"Is it possible to not have to do sendlater as the last thing?
Currently, once you use send later the msg is saved to drafts folder
and the write window closes. Often I find I am writing something and
think to myself I better put the delay time on now so that I don't
forget and accidentally send it now, but then I have to repoen to
continue and then have the previous problem. It would be nice to be
able to enter the sendlater time, then continue writing and when you
hit send or sendlater buttons it just acts like you've hit the
non-delayed sendnow button, in that it just 'goes away' and does its
thing later"

Shortcut buttons don't trigger spell-checking or check for missing
Subject.

Interacts badly with "Place replies in the folder of the message being
replied to" option -- messages end up being filed in Inbox. Need to
look into the mechanics of how that option works and see if there's a
way to fix the behavior.

Change the "Send around" button into a button plus a label next to it
to make it clearer that it's a button.

Add an option to prompt the user whether to send overdue messages when
Thunderbird starts up.

Compatibility with the www.spamfighter.com Thunderbird add-on.

Better user experience when editing a scheduled draft. E.g., should
trying to close the draft window without rescheduling cause a pop-up
asking the user to confirm? The thing we want to avoid is having
someone save an edited, previously scheduled draft, intending for it
to be rescheduled but forgetting to do so.

"It would be nice to be able to specify a random number in a range be
added to the send time for recurring messages. E.g., if the message
was scheduled to be sent at 9am and 10 was specified as the range and
the '+/-' box was checked, then the message would be sent at a random
time between 10 minutes before 9 and 10 minutes after 9. The idea is
to avoid the appearance that the message is being scheduled."

  "I've refined my idea a little. Instead of a check box, it would be a
  radio box with the options +, - and +/-. So, for example, the
  following three scenarios would work: send at a random time at or
  after 9am, send at a random time until 5pm, and send at a random
  time before or after noon."

Options => Delivery Format => Plain Text doesn't work.
